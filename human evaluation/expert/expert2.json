The trials compared different antibiotics with each other. We found that there was not enough evidence from the trials to show that using a combination of multiple antibiotic treatments or administering antibiotics for an increased duration is of benefit to people undergoing surgery in reducing MRSA infections. We also found that in the trials that compared one antibiotic treatment to another, there were no differences in the proportion of people who developed infections. In the one trial that compared an antibiotic regimen with no antibiotic treatment, the proportion that developed infections was lower in the people who received antibiotic treatment with co-amoxiclav (or cefotaxime if allergic to penicillin) compared with those who did not receive antibiotic treatment. This may have been due to decreasing overall infection, preventing wounds from becoming infected.

We found five trials involving 3427 people. These trials were conducted in Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK, France and the USA. The overall quality of the studies was low or very low for overall survival, and was high for other results, as there was not enough information about which treatment was being given. The evidence is current up until September 2016. We included in this review the results from the EORTC 20012 study, which showed that patients with advanced HL who were given chemotherapy in the advanced stage of the disease had a better survival than those who were not given chemotherapy. We also found that patients who received chemotherapy in advanced stage HL were more likely than patients who did not receive chemotherapy to have fewer side effects. However, we are very uncertain how many female patients will become infertile due to chemotherapy and which treatment might be favoured. We are also uncertain about how many male patients will be affected by chemotherapy, as the age of the patients was not clearly described. This review shows that adult patients with early unfavourable HL are more likely to live longer after treatment than those patients who do not receive treatment. We did not find evidence that there was a difference in the number of people who died after treatment, or the number who developed secondary malignancies. We judged the quality of evidence as moderate, which means that we are confident in the results. The quality was very low or low because there were too few people included in the studies.

We found that women who had CTG were more likely than women who did not have CTG to have a caesarean section to have their baby born. Furthermore, the probability is that admission CTG increases the chance that their baby will be born by about 20%. There was no clear difference in the average treatment effect between women who received CTG and women who were not given CTG during instrumental vaginal birth. Women who had a CTG also had higher rates of continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour, fetal blood sampling and fetal blood tests. However, we did not find that there was a clear difference with regard to the number of babies who died or had severe birth defects in the neonatal period. There was not enough information for us to draw any conclusions about the effect that the CTG might have on the risk that the baby had severe brain damage in the early years of life. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low quality to moderate. The findings of this review support recommendations that the use of CTG should not be used in women who are low risk on admission to hospital.

In addition, we found no relevant economic evaluations assessing the efficiency of the different imaging strategies. The effect of different imaging schedules on survival and other health outcomes remains largely unknown. The limited evidence suggesting that early postoperative brain imaging among GBM patients who will receive combined chemoradiation treatment may make little or no difference to survival needs to be further researched, particularly as early pre-operatory imaging also serves as a quality control measure that may lead to early re-operation if residual tumour is identified. Mathematical modelling of a large glioma patient database could help to distinguish the optimal timing of surveillance imaging for different types of gliomas, with stratification of patients facilitated by assessment of individual tumour growth rates, molecular biomarkers and other prognostic factors, in addition, paediatric studies could be used to inform future research of imaging strategies among adults.","label":["Factuality 2"]},{"id":"10.1002\/14651858.CD011655.pub2_1","text":"Unsimplified text:\nWe included three studies randomising 161 people with schizophrenia.\nData were available for only two of our seven prestated main outcomes.\nClinically important improvement in global state was measured using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI).\nThere was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and metiapine groups (2 RCTs, n = 120, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47, very low quality evidence) and numbers of participants with parkinsonism at eight weeks were similar (2 RCTs, n = 70, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.03, very low quality evidence).\nThere were no useable data available for the other key outcomes of clinically important improvement in mental state, readmission due to relapse, satisfaction with treatment, aggressive or violent behaviour, or cost of care.\nChlorpromazine has been the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia for decades, yet available evidence comparing this drug to metiapine fails to provide high-quality trial based data.\nHowever, the need to determine whether metiapine is more or less effective than chlorpromazine seems to be lacking in clinical relevance and future research on this comparison seems unlikely.\n\n\nSimplified text:\nWe found three randomised controlled trials, involving 161 people with schizophrenia, that compared chlorpromazine with metiapine.

The interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning by evaluating work changes or adaptations and by providing vocational counselling, advice or education. The duration or dose of the interventions varied from six to eight sessions over six months, but the majority of the studies were of very low quality. We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. The evidence is current up to January 2015. We judged the quality to have been very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about the results.
