There was no significant difference in the number of people developing MRSA infections at any body site in these two comparisons. There is currently no other evidence to suggest that using a combination of multiple antibiotics or administering antibiotics for an increased duration is of benefit to people undergoing surgery in terms of reducing MRSA infection. In two trials, 19\/478 (4.5%) people developed MRSA infected infections including SSI, chest infection and bacteraemia. In one trial in which all the participants were positive for nasal carriage of MRSA or had had previous MRSA, it does not appear that MRSA was tested or eradicated prior to surgery, nor does it appear that there was high prevalence of the MRSA carrier status in the people undergoing the surgery. Prophylactic antibiotics for the duration of the trial were not associated with an increase in the risk of developing SSIs, although this may be due to decreasing overall infection thereby preventing wounds from becoming secondarily infected with MRSA. Well designed RCTs assessing the clinical effectiveness of different antibiotics regimens are necessary on this topic.","label":["Factuality 2","Fluency 2","Simplicity 0"]},{"id":"10.1002\/14651858.CD008053.pub3_0","text":"Unsimplified text:\nWe included two trials (116 women) comparing planned home versus hospital management for PPROM.\nOverall, the number of included women in each trial was too small to allow adequate assessment of pre-specified outcomes.\nInvestigators used strict inclusion criteria and in both studies relatively few of the women presenting with PPROM were eligible for inclusion.\nWomen were monitored for 48 to 72 hours before randomisation.\nPerinatal mortality was reported in one trial and there was insufficient evidence to determine whether it differed between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 20.05).  \nThere was no evidence of differences between groups for serious neonatal morbidity, chorioamnionitis, gestational age at delivery, birthweight and admission to neonatal intensive care.\nThere was no information on serious maternal morbidity or mortality.\nThere was some evidence that women managed in hospital were more likely to be delivered by caesarean section (RR (random-effects) 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.15).\nHowever, results should be interpreted cautiously as there is moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 35%).\nMothers randomised to care at home spent approximately 10 fewer days as inpatients (mean difference -9.60, 95% CI -14.59 to -4.61) and were more satisfied with their care.\nFurthermore, home care was associated with reduced costs.\nThe review included two relatively small studies that did not have sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences between groups.\nFuture large and adequately powered randomised controlled trials are required to measure differences between groups for relevant pre-specified outcomes.\nSpecial attention should be given to the assessment of maternal satisfaction with care and cost analysis as they will have social and economic implications in both developed and developing countries.\n\n\nSimplified text:\nWe searched the medical literature for studies that compared planned home care with hospital care.

We found five trials involving 3427 people. These trials were conducted in Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK, France and the USA. The overall quality of the studies was low or very low for overall survival, and was high for other results, as there was not enough information about which treatment was being given. The evidence is current up until September 2016. We included in this review the results from the EORTC 20012 study, which showed that patients with advanced HL who were given chemotherapy in the advanced stage of the disease had a better survival than those who were not given chemotherapy. We also found that patients who received chemotherapy in advanced stage HL were more likely than patients who did not receive chemotherapy to have fewer side effects. However, we are very uncertain how many female patients will become infertile due to chemotherapy and which treatment might be favoured. We are also uncertain about how many male patients will be affected by chemotherapy, as the age of the patients was not clearly described. This review shows that adult patients with early unfavourable HL are more likely to live longer after treatment than those patients who do not receive treatment.

These trials included only adults. The trials were co-ordinated in Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. The overall risk of bias was low for overall survival (OS), but was high for other outcomes, as therapy blinding was not feasible. This review does for the first time suggest a survival benefit. This means that only 90 (70 to 117) patients will die after five years in the BEACOPP escalated arm compared to 120 in the ABVD arm. The proven benefit in OS for patients with advanced HL is a new finding of this updated review due to the inclusion of the results from the EORTC 20012 trial. However, the observation time of the studies included in the review is too short to be expected to demonstrate differences with respect to second solid tumours, which would not be expected until around 15 years after treatment. Furthermore, there is only low-quality evidence of a difference in the total number of secondary malignancies, as the follow-up period might be too short. Only one trial planned to assess quality of life, however, no results were reported. This is a very small sample, and the age of the patients was not detailed. This meta-analysis provides moderate- to high quality evidence that adult patients with early unfavourable and advanced stage HL benefit regarding OS and progression-free survival (PFS) from first-line chemotherapy including escalated BEACopP. The quality of the evidence is moderate to high for OS and PFS because of the small number of participants in the included trials and the small numbers of patients in the studies. It is clear from this treatment may be more toxic than ABVD, and very important long-term side effects such as infertility have not been sufficiently analysed yet. Due to the availability of only very low quality evidence available, we are unable to come to a conclusion in terms of infertility.","label":["Factuality 2","Fluency 2","Simplicity 1"]},{"id":"10.1002\/14651858.CD007569.pub3_0","text":"Unsimplified text:\nFifteen RCTs including 1835 cancer patients met the inclusion criteria and because of multiple arms studies we included 19 evaluations.\nWe judged six studies to have a high risk of bias and nine to have a low risk of bias.\nAll included studies were conducted in high income countries and most studies were aimed at breast cancer patients (seven trials) or prostate cancer patients (two trials).\nTwo studies involved psycho-educational interventions including patient education and teaching self-care behaviours.\nResults indicated low quality evidence of similar RTW rates for psycho-educational interventions compared to care as usual (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.35, n = 260 patients) and low quality evidence that there is no difference in the effect of psycho-educational interventions compared to care as usual on quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.05, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.3, n = 260 patients).\nWe did not find any studies on vocational interventions.\nIn one study breast cancer patients were offered a physical training programme.\nLow quality evidence suggested that physical training was not more effective than care as usual in improving RTW (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.32 to 4.54, n = 28 patients) or quality of life (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.99 to 0.25, n = 41 patients).\nSeven RCTs assessed the effects of a medical intervention on RTW.\nIn all studies a less radical or functioning conserving medical intervention was compared with a more radical treatment.\nWe found low quality evidence that less radical, functioning conserving approaches had similar RTW rates as more radical treatments (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09, n = 1097 patients) and moderate quality evidence of no differences in quality of life outcomes (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.23, n = 1028 patients).\nFive RCTs involved multidisciplinary interventions in which vocational counselling, patient education, patient counselling, biofeedback-assisted behavioral training and\/or physical exercises were combined.\nModerate quality evidence showed that multidisciplinary interventions involving physical, psycho-educational and\/or vocational components led to higher RTW rates than care as usual (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16, n = 450 patients).\nWe found no differences in the effect of multidisciplinary interventions compared to care as usual on quality of life outcomes (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.25, n = 316 patients).\nWe found moderate quality evidence that multidisciplinary interventions enhance the RTW of patients with cancer.\n\n\nSimplified text:\nWe found 15 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one treatment or the other) including 1835 cancer patients.

In certain circumstances (e.g. patients who are not eligible for heart surgery, or those who have complex lesions), the drug may help patients to return to normal activities of daily life.","label":["Factuality 1","Fluency 1","Simplicity 1"]},{"id":"10.1002\/14651858.CD003334.pub2_1","text":"Unsimplified text:\nWe included 12 trials enrolling 3474 patients. \nThe overall risk of bias was unclear for the majority of articles due to a lack of reported data; however, the authors determined that this would be unlikely to impact negatively as most data outcomes were objective (e.g. death vs. no death).\nThere was no evidence of the effectiveness in improving patient outcomes of PTCRA in non-complex lesions. \nIn complex lesions, there were no statistically significant differences in re-stenosis rates at six months (RR 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.33) and at one year (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55) in those receiving PTCRA with adjunctive balloon angioplasty (PTCA) (PTCRA\/PTCA) compared to those receiving PTCA alone.\nMorphological characteristics distinguishing complex lesions have not been examined in parallel-arm randomised controlled trials.\nThe evidence for the effectiveness of PTCRA in in-stent re-stenosis is unclear Compared to angioplasty alone, PTCRA\/PTCA did not result in a statistically significant increase in the risk of major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction (MI), emergency cardiac surgery or death) during the in-hospital period (RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.90).\nCompared to angioplasty, PTCRA was associated with nine times the risk of an angiographically detectable vascular spasm (RR 9.23; 95% CI 4.61 to 18.47), four times the risk of perforation (RR 4.28; 95% CI 0.92 to 19.83) and about twice the risk of transient vessel occlusions (RR 2.49; 95% CI 1.25 to 4.99) while angiographic dissections (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.68) and stents used as a bailout procedure (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.87) were less common.\nWhen conventional PTCA is feasible, PTCRA appears to confer no additional benefits.\nThere is limited published evidence and no long-term data to support the routine use of PTCRA in in-stent re-stenosis.\nCompared to angioplasty alone, PTCRA\/PTCA did not result in a higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events, but patients were more likely to experience vascular spasm, perforation and transient vessel occlusion.\nIn certain circumstances (e.g. patients ineligible for cardiac surgery, those with architecturally complex lesions, or those with lesions that fail PTCA), PTCRA may achieve satisfactory re-vascularisation in subsequent procedures.\n\n\nSimplified text:\nWe included 12 randomised controlled trials enrolling 3474 patients.
