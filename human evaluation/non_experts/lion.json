Five studies had a classic design in which participants were randomised at the start of the treatment to either pregabalin (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily) or placebo, with assessment after 8 to 13 weeks of treatment. Two studies had an EERW design, where those with good pain relief after starting treatment were randomly assigned to either continuing the treatment (300 to 600 mg or placebo daily), or stopping treatment at the end of the study, or continuing treatment for at least 26 weeks. We included eight studies in this review. The studies had low to very low methodological quality, which means that we are uncertain about the results. The evidence is current to August 2016. Pregabalin increased the number of people with moderate or severe pain who experienced substantial or moderate pain reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' treatment. This was similar to other effective medicines in fibromyalgia, such as duloxetine, but was not as good as other painkillers. The number needed for pain relief was about 1.7, 7.4, 18, 18 and 19 for moderate, moderate, or very good pain reduction, and about 2.3, 10, 15, 20, 24, or 24 for moderate or very much better pain relief. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low quality to very good quality. Withdrawals from the studies were more common than with placebo (withdrawals due to side effects were about 10% more common), but withdrawals were about 6% lower (high quality of evidence), mainly because of side effects. Serious side effects did not differ between active treatment and placebo (very low quality evidence), which means we are very uncertain about these results. Side effects included dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, abdominal pain, tiredness, drowsiness, and tiredness.

This review highlights the paucity of evidence available to evaluate the effectiveness, despite the known success of these interventions in non-Indigenous populations. The limited but available evidence reported does indicate that smoking cessation treatments specifically targeted to Indigenous populations can produce smoking abstinence. However, this evidence base is not strong with a small number of methodologically sound trials investigating these interventions. More rigorous trials are now required to assist in bridging the gap between tobacco related health disparities in Indigenous and other populations.","label":["Factuality 1","Fluency 0","Simplicity 0"]},{"id":"10.1002\/14651858.CD003408.pub3_0","text":"Unsimplified text:\nWe included 13 studies (5686 patients).\nWe judged blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment to be at high risk in about 50% of the included studies and at low risk in 25% to 30% of the studies.\nRegardless of the high risk of performance bias these studies were included based on the low weight the studies had in the meta-analysis.\nWe rated 75% of the studies as low risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias.\nAll 13 studies reported some type of hospital mortality (28-day, 30-day, 60-day or ICU mortality).\nWe considered studies of high-risk surgery patients (eight studies) and general intensive care patients (five studies) separately as subgroups for meta-analysis.\nThe pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality for the studies of general intensive care patients was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.09) and for the studies of high-risk surgery patients the RR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.29).\nOf the eight studies of high-risk surgery patients, five evaluated the effectiveness of pre-operative optimization but there was no difference in mortality when these studies were examined separately.\nPAC did not affect general ICU LOS (reported by four studies) or hospital LOS (reported by nine studies).\nFour studies, conducted in the United States (US), reported costs based on hospital charges billed, which on average were higher in the PAC groups.\nTwo of these studies qualified for analysis and did not show a statistically significant hospital cost difference (mean difference USD 900, 95% CI -2620 to 4420, P = 0.62).\nPAC is a diagnostic and haemodynamic monitoring tool but not a therapeutic intervention.\nOur review concluded that use of a PAC did not alter the mortality, general ICU or hospital LOS, or cost for adult patients in intensive care.\nThe quality of evidence was high for mortality and LOS but low for cost analysis.\nEfficacy studies are needed to determine if there are optimal PAC-guided management protocols, which when applied to specific patient groups in ICUs could result in benefits such as shock reversal, improved organ function and less vasopressor use.\nNewer, less-invasive haemodynamic monitoring tools need to be validated against PAC prior to clinical use in critically ill patients.\n\n\nSimplified text:\nWe searched the medical literature up to January 2014 and found 13 studies involving a total of 5686 patients.

Very low quality evidence suggests that yoga might be as effective as other exercise interventions and might be used as an alternative to other exercise programmes.","label":["Factuality 2","Fluency 2","Simplicity 2"]},{"id":"10.1002\/14651858.CD013137.pub2_0","text":"Unsimplified text:\nWe included one retrospective, single-institution study that compared post-operative imaging within 48 hours (early post-operative imaging) with no early post-operative imaging among 125 people who had surgery for glioblastoma (GBM: World Health Organization (WHO) grade 4 glioma).\nMost patients in the study underwent maximal surgical resection followed by combined radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment.\nAlthough patient characteristics in the study arms were comparable, the study was at high risk of bias overall.\nEvidence from this study suggested little or no difference between early and no early post-operative imaging with respect to overall survival (deaths) at one year after diagnosis of GBM (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.21; 48% vs 55% died, respectively; very low certainty evidence) and little or no difference in overall survival (deaths) at two years after diagnosis of GBM (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25; 86% vs 81% died, respectively; very low certainty evidence).\nNo other review outcomes were reported.\nWe found no evidence on the effectiveness of other imaging schedules.\nIn addition, we identified no relevant economic evaluations assessing the efficiency of the different imaging strategies.\nThe effect of different imaging strategies on survival and other health outcomes remains largely unknown.\nExisting imaging schedules in glioma seem to be pragmatic rather than evidence-based.\nThe limited evidence suggesting that early post-operative brain imaging among GBM patients who will receive combined chemoradiation treatment may make little or no difference to survival needs to be further researched, particularly as early post-operative imaging also serves as a quality control measure that may lead to early re-operation if residual tumour is identified.\nMathematical modelling of a large glioma patient database could help to distinguish the optimal timing of surveillance imaging for different types of glioma, with stratification of patients facilitated by assessment of individual tumour growth rates, molecular biomarkers and other prognostic factors.\nIn addition, paediatric glioma study designs could be used to inform future research of imaging strategies among adults with glioma.\n\n\nSimplified text:\nWe searched the medical literature for studies that compared different imaging schedules in people who had surgery for glioblastoma.

In addition, since some of the included studies included unplanned subgroup analysis that suggested differential effects based on previous vitamin A exposure, investigators should consider examining this issue.","label":["Factuality 1","Fluency 1","Simplicity 0"]},{"id":"10.1002\/14651858.CD010208.pub2_0","text":"Unsimplified text:\nWe included three RCTs with a total of 414 participants at risk of job loss.\nThe majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS.\nThe interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning in several ways: firstly by evaluating work changes or adaptations and secondly by providing any person-directed interventions including vocational counselling, advice or education.\nInterventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits (one trial) or any actions by an occupational physician (one trial).\nThe duration or dose of the interventions varied from two 1.5-hour sessions (one RCT) over five months, two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months (one RCT), to six to eight individual or group sessions over six months (also one RCT).\nAll participants were recruited through rheumatology clinics, both in or outside hospitals.\nIncluded trials investigated job loss (n = two RCTs; 382 participants), work absenteeism and work functioning (n = one RCT; 32 participants).\nOverall, we evaluated the two smaller trials as having a high risk of bias and the large trial as having a low risk of bias.\nTrials showed marked differences in how they performed on risk of bias items, particularly on performance bias.\nWe assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach and judged there to be very low quality evidence across the three reported outcomes.\nOf the two RCTs investigating job loss, the larger one (n = 242 participants) reported a large statistically significant reduction in job loss (relative risk (RR) = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.68) and the other RCT (n = 140) reported similar effects in both groups, although the CI was very wide (RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.06).\nThe latter one probably suffered from performance bias and we judged it to have a high risk of bias.\nThe one small trial investigating sickness absenteeism found uncertain results at six months' follow-up (MD = -2.42 days, 95% CI -5.03 to 0.19).\nFinally, in the same small trial investigating work functioning using the Rheumatoid Arthritis-Work Instability Scale (RA-WIS), there was a moderate improvement of intermediate term work functioning (six months; scale range 0 to 23; mean improvement -4.67 points, 95% CI -8.43 to -0.91).\nWe identified no adverse effects in the publications of the three trials.\nThis Cochrane review of three RCTs found very low quality evidence overall for job loss prevention interventions having an effect on job loss, work absenteeism and work functioning in workers with inflammatory arthritis.\nWhile this review highlights that further high quality RCTs are required, the results suggest that these strategies have potential to be effective.\n\n\nSimplified text:\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared the effects on job loss, work absenteeism and work functioning (i.e. the number of people who dropped out of work because they were sick or did not show up to work) or who were not able or unwilling to work.

Most trials did not report any significant differences between the study arms in breastfeeding duration, breast milk volume, or infant growth. The quality of the evidence was moderate overall and low for three of four placebo-controlled trials. Exceptions were seen mainly in older studies with limited information. Five trials indicated that there was little or no difference between the two methods for the length of time women breastfed their babies. For breast milk weight gain, two older studies indicated lower milk volume for the COC group compared to the placebo. One of the other studies did not quantify results. Of four trials that assessed infant growth, one showed greater weight gain for the implant group but less compared with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) from 6 weeks to 12 weeks. Another four trials reported that there were no differences for the study groups. The overall quality was moderate to low. The main limitations of this review were the small number of women included in the studies and the small numbers.","label":["Factuality 1","Fluency 2","Simplicity 0"]},{"id":"10.1002\/14651858.CD003988.pub2_1","text":"Unsimplified text:\nIn 2014, we added seven trials for a new total of 11.\nFive reports were published before 1985 and six from 2005 to 2014.\nThey included 1482 women.\nFour trials examined combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and three studied a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).\nWe found two trials of progestin-only pills (POPs) and two of the etonogestrel-releasing implant.\nOlder studies often lacked quantified results.\nMost trials did not report significant differences between the study arms in breastfeeding duration, breast milk composition, or infant growth.\nExceptions were seen mainly in older studies with limited information.\nFor breastfeeding duration, two of eight trials indicated a negative effect on lactation.\nA COC study reported a negative effect on lactation duration compared to placebo but did not quantify results.\nAnother trial showed a lower percentage of the LNG-IUS group breastfeeding at 75 days versus the nonhormonal IUD group (reported P < 0.05) but no significant difference at one year.\nFor breast milk volume, two older studies indicated lower volume for the COC group versus the placebo group.\nOne trial did not quantify results.\nThe other showed lower means (mL) for the COC group, e.g. at 16 weeks (MD -24.00, 95% CI -34.53 to -13.47) and at 24 weeks (MD -24.90, 95% CI -36.01 to -13.79).\nAnother four trials did not report any significant difference between the study groups in milk volume or composition with two POPs, a COC, or the etonogestrel implant.\nSeven trials studied infant growth; one showed greater weight gain (grams) for the etonogestrel implant versus no method for six weeks (MD 426.00, 95% CI 58.94 to 793.06) but less compared with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) from 6 to 12 weeks (MD -271.00, 95% CI -355.10 to -186.90).\nThe others studied POPs, COCs versus POPs, or an LNG-IUS.\nResults were not consistent across the 11 trials.\nThe evidence was limited for any particular hormonal method.\nThe quality of evidence was moderate overall and low for three of four placebo-controlled trials of COCs or POPs.\nThe sensitivity analysis included six trials with moderate quality evidence and sufficient outcome data.\nFive trials indicated no significant difference between groups in breastfeeding duration (etonogestrel implant insertion times, COC versus POP, and LNG-IUS).\nFor breast milk volume or composition, a COC study showed a negative effect, while an implant trial showed no significant difference.\nOf four trials that assessed infant growth, three indicated no significant difference between groups.\nOne showed greater weight gain in the etonogestrel implant group versus no method but less versus DMPA.\n\n\nSimplified text:\nWe found seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included 1482 women.
