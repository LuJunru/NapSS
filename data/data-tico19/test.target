 if needed
 during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients."
It is necessary to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the stress and return to normal life.
 COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features from SARS."
 SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection
 infected patients at the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities

 including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 health-care providers."
 great precaution should be used to protect humans
The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
 where they could be passed on to others."
 only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm
 health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks."
 health-care providers should wear fitted isolation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses."
Viruses can also infect people through the eyes.

 health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles while working with patients."
 it is highly suggested that everybody wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual
3 feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
"These actions are effective ways to lower the risk of infection
 its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert to China based on her deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003."
 not until 19 January 2020 did the director of the Center of Disease Control of Wuhan comfort the citizens by saying that the novel virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductivity from human to human and that it is not a problem to prevent and contain the disease."
 especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival
The disease control agencies in China may take this hard lesson and make important improvements in the future.
"The outbreak of COVID-19
 it has spread all over China and near 50 other countries globally at the time of this writing."
 the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurring."
 there are some remarkable differences between COVID-19 and SARS
 and the severity and death rate are also higher in elderly individual than in youth."
SARS has higher death rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
 which causes much greater difficulty to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS."
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
 cured patients can be positive for the virus again."
These findings dramatically increase the risk of virus spreading.
 several critical issues remain to be solved
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
 we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats."
 say bats
 currently there is no evidence in support of a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs."
 the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs."
 pangolins and other mammals remains to be established."
 SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs
The high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 may be driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
 recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs."
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
 the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E
 while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents."
It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
 HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV
 the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure ​1 and Table 2."
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history.
 a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded."
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
"Between them
Several pieces of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.
 humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche."
 humans have close contact with alpacas."
 HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats
 alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals."
 the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans."
 bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus
It is therefore not unlikely that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
 whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by more recent findings.
Bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic material and interspecies transmission.
 densely packed colonies
 MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades."
"These camels have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and has quite a low mutation rate in these animals.
Its irregular transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV; its transmission cannot be sustained.
 pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins."
 similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV."
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to figured out in future studies.
 bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2."
Humans might share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.
 pangolins could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced."
Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat.
"It is possible that many mammals
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is called for.
 as mentioned above
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.
 three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers."
 their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication."
 deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability."
 the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
 mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts."
 mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host."
 the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower
 it has already been adapted to another host close to humans."
 this also applies to MERS-CoV
 it is unlikely that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly."
 the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination
This is supported by the large amount of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
 CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique “copy-choice” mechanism."
 strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription."
Highly similar full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs.
 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9."
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
 viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies transmission."
 recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example
 SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts
 the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response."
 the RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment
 including bat
 only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the RBD and 4 of them locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor."
 which might increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptor."
 these two amino acid substitutions might be critical to viral adaption to humans."
It is important that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 might have changed. 
 a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein."
It will also be of interest to find out whether any other coreceptor might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
 HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S."
 such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E
They might also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
 the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host dependency and restriction factors."
 dromedary camels and rodents might constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission."
HCoVs have to take over host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for a successful interspecies transmission.
 molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain to be identified and characterized."
"An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to ground zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides plenty of opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
 bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs."
 rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process."
 the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes."
 ORF8 has been thought to be important in adaptation to humans
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the start of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b; it is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the switch of hosts.
 SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs
 most of nsp10
 it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages
 recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs
 most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted
 owing to a two-nucleotide deletion."
 the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide insertion
 the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts."
 indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats."
"It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs
 defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs."
 the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules."
 the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease
 leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation."
 it is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades."
"CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts
They replicate robustly without triggering a strong host immune response.
"Herein are the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen
 the more severe the lung damage."
 in asymptomatic carriers
The same method of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The anti-viral response is particularly strong in bats.
 administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial."
 NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective."
 inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19."
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general way SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose.
 there also exists a bat-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2."
 immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified."
 indicating that pangolins might serve as one of intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2."
 there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either deliberately or accidentally."
"CoVs have returned to the spotlight
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat origin and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts."
 closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic."
 pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission
 whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remain to be clarified in future investigations."
 MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time."

They are widely found across the Middle East and Africa.
 as what was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spreading of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2."
 a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels
 new genotypes might emerge to cause outbreaks."
A variety of animal CoVs are circulating in the wild.
 bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are so diverse."
 resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in future."
The culture of eating wild animals in some places of China should be stopped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
 MERS and COVID-19
 many viruses have existed in the planet for a very long time."
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance to leave 
 the chance for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from them."
 which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks."
 the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses."
Several pieces in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
 if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins
 if bats play a more direct role in human transmission
 if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host
 since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
 a pangolin or another mammal
 with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans."

ACE2 counters the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7). This makes it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.

Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
There is a long history of using blood collected from patients who have recovered from contagious disease. It can be used to treat other patient suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individual from catching the disease.
 recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood."
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects. They recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and kill them directly.
 plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 seriously ill patients."

 verification and clarification are necessary to propose the method for large-scale use before specific therapies are not yet developed."
 given the therapeutic effects
 antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome
 and the demand for the plasma is large to treat critically ill patients."
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quick enough to fight against a global outbreak.
 it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus."
 we can readily scale up the production of the antibodies."

Human coronaviruses originated from animals
 including human beings
 two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to show how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be.
"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has placed CoVs into the spotlight again. It has surprised us with its high transmissibility
HCoV infection is a zoonosis. Understanding the animal orgin of HCoVs would serve us well.
Most HCoVs emerged from bats where they are non-infectious.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Prevention of human diseases is directly associated with identifying the animal hosts.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in animal might also show important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans.
 we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs
 we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination."

We also review the trend of HCoV evolution. The increase in transmissibility often comes with the decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.

 Comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and other six HCoVs show similarities and differences of great interest.
 the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar."
 SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs."
 the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E
 SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs
 a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection
 the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV."
 the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs."
 it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV."

The importance and role of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 are seasonal like community acquired HCoVs.
 the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility
All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
 it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs."
 both could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics."
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
 HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors."
 the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people that it infects
 its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures."

These viruses do not need an animal host. 
 highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained."

 it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV."
It is yet to be known whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host. 
 it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it has a closely related ancestor sharing high level of similar genes.
The ancient virus is usually well adapted and non infectious in this host.
 a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and for long term."
 the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus."
 if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host right before or around its introduction to humans
This intermediate host can serve as the animal origin of human infection. It plays the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to multiply. It's the. Transmits the virus to humans and multiply into the scale of human infection. 
"An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection
 HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity."
 the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host."
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the key case of SARS had a contact history with game animals.
Subsequent study on serology showed that anti-SARS-CoV antibody was more common among animal traders than that of the general population. 
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported as there were no new cases of SARS reported after killing all civets in the market.
 it has been reported that masked palm civets from the wild or farms without exposure to the live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV
 since 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies
All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.

These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% genetic similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging human diseases.

"Genetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are genetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs found in Europe and Africa.
 no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats."
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% genetic similarity.
 bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV."
 studies in Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies
 further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV."
"In camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV
 infected camels shed viruses not only through respiratory route but also through fecal-oral route
 questions still remain since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% genetic similarity with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
 the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to assign parental relationship."
 bats might not be the immediate reservoir host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat CoVs are found in future."
 the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also cultivate ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% genetic sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
 they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the level of nucleotide sequence."
 one of which share a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2
 the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent
 which turn out to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2."
This study adopted different assembly methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence. It consisted about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
The possibility that pangolin being one of the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. 
This is one line of scientific research which is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Analyzing those binding sites provide the reasonable project of developing effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
