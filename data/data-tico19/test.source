and all chest pain should be treated this way especially with your age
and i want you to describe where the chest pain is
and they're having some fevers as well
and along with a fever
and also needs to be checked your cholesterol blood pressure
but you're breathing all right right now right?
cause of this chest pain i totally forgot
does it feel like somebody squeezing your chest
and are you having a fever now?
do still feel like shortness of breath
do they complain of being sick similar symptoms?
do you have any other chronic like high blood pressure or anything like that?
do you have any other diseases chronic medical problems like diabetes?

Updating the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 “suspected case” and “confirmed case” is necessary
"On 6 February 2020
"However
"In this letter
"In December 2019
"On 11 March 2020
"In order to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection
It has attracted a great attention since published.
"Note however that COVID-19 is a new disease
"For instance the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/)
"Now our guideline received a comment by Zhou et al.
Their work added new evidence for our guideline and also make valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We endorse their significant work and express our thanks.
"However
"According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020)
"Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas
"Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal
"Diagnosing the confirmed case should base on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence as following: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in serum test; or a change of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody from negative to positive
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
"These modifications based on the researchers continued work that to search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis
"Besides
"Hence
The score system also needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
"To conclude
"For the diagnosis of “suspected case” and “confirmed case”
Our team will also timely update our guideline to offer help.
"Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom
"The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that
"Based on the experience from Italy
"On 31 December 2019
"On 9 January 2020
"Since
"Evidence to date is that ca 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild disease
"In ca 14% cases
The mortality of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
"In this study
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
"Subsequent to China
"On 11 March 2020
"In the 5 March issue of Eurosurveillance 2020
"In the EU/EEA
"As at 15 March 2020
"A study performed in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe
"This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100
"Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation
"Since cases have so far clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The experience from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
"Countries
"As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on healthcare.
"Failing this
"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
"Similar to its homologous virus
"However
"In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease
"We will cover the basics about the epidemiology
"Although many questions still require answers
"The Spring Festival on January 25
"The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus
"The epidemic started in Wuhan
"As of March 2
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “public enemy number 1” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
"According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)
This review attempts to summarize the research progress in the new and swiftly developing subject area.
"Whenever possible
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some remaining yet urgent questions.
"CoVs have been traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens to humans
"However
"Therefore
"As shown in Fig. ​Fig.1
Seven days later the sequence of the CoV was released.
"On January 15
"Meanwhile
"On January 20
"On January 23
"On January 24 the first clinical study on the disease reported that
"On January 30
"By the time of this report
"As the situation is rapidly evolving
"On February 11
"Thus
"In general
"Through different pathways
"However
"Soon
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in the defense.
"CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
"However
The humoral immunity including complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also essential in combating the viral infection.
"For example
"On the other hand
"The SARS-CoV-2 infection
"It is common that for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised
"The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days
"However
"A more recent study
"It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period
"As a common practice
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
"Fever is often the major and initial symptom of COVID-19
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
"In severe cases
"Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever
"A demographic study in late December of 2019 showed that the percentages of the symptoms were 98% for fever
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
"Comparably
"However
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed with MERS patients.
"In SARS patients
"By February 14
"Comparably
"For MERS
"An earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23
"A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding their symptoms
"The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV
Clustered onset often happens in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the recent two weeks before the onset.
"However
Patients have normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
"For example
"The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients
"In patients with severe cases
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and featured by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
"Patients often develop an atypical pneumonia
"When ARDS happens
"Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension
"Therefore
"On February 18
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the major criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
"However
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
"Therefore
"On February 14
"Hopefully
"Due to the lack of experience with the novel CoV
Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
"SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks
"Nevertheless
"Thus
"Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
"In addition
It has been known that a cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main reason for death in SARS patients.
"It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other.
"Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential prognostic factor for disease
The correlation of CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
"In addition
"These enzymes are expressed extensively in multiple organs
"Thus
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
"Use of steroids: As described above
"Since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS patients
"Thus
"Mental stress: As described above
It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the stress and return to normal life.
"According to demographic studies so far
"In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract
"Therefore
"However
"Thus
Great efforts are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
"Although these actions have been dramatically damaging the economy and other sectors of the country
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downswing phase will last for 3-4 months.
"However
"Paul Hunter
"Ira Longini
"A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier
"However
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
"However
"It is possible
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. ​(Fig.55).
"SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmittable through coughing or sneezing
"The virus was also found in feces
"A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections
"Thus
The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
"Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials
"However
"Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together
"In addition to masks
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.
"On January 22
"Thus
"For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to lower the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
"Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world
"However
"This message remarkably relaxed the alarm of the public
The disease control agencies in China may take this hard lesson and make critical improvements in the future.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 started in the end of December 2019.
"In less than two months
"Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS
"However
"COVID-19 affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
"COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless whereas SARS patients do so usually when they are severely ill
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
"On the other hand
These findings dramatically increase the risk of virus spreading.
"Given such rapid progress in research on COVID-19
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
"Although 96% genetic homolog was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs
"What animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host
"However
"In addition
"The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats
"Whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
"As a driving force in evolution
The jury is still out on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
"Besides the highly pathogenic HCoVs
"Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E might have originated from bat CoVs
It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat displayed close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
"On the other hand
"For clarity
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in the history.
"When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.
"First
"Instead
"Second
"Finally
"Thus
"In fact
It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
"Alternatively
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
"Longevity
"On the other hand
It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
"Particularly
"They might be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to be ruled in or ruled out in future studies.
"First
Humans might share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.
"Second
Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.
"Third
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.
"Apart from different types of the animal hosts
"First of all
"CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease
"Interestingly
Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
"Nevertheless
"In addition
"Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate
"Presumably
"In addition to SARS-CoV-2
"Theoretically
"Second
This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
"Third
"In a host that serves as the mixing vessel
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs.
"Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
"Besides three viral factors stated above
"Herein
"Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoVs
"Generally
"In SARS-CoV
"The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals
"In fact
"Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD
"In other words
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 might have altered.
"Indeed
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
"Intriguingly
"There exist many other HCoV receptors
They might also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
"In addition to cellular receptors
"The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats
HCoVs have to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for a successful interspecies transmission.
"In this regard
An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR might be fruitful.
Emergence of novel HCoVs: back to ground zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
"In this sense
"In addition
"For example
"Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the switch of hosts.
"Besides
"Recombination locations were also identified in the nsp9
"Likewise
"Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
"It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes
"An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain
"While intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E
"Last but not least
"Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs
It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
"For example
"Besides
"Moreover
"More pathogenic CoV strains might also evolve by recombination
"Thus
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response.
Herein lie the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes the severe cases in human infection.
"The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm wherein the stronger the immune response
"In contrast
The same strategy of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
"Thus
"In addition
"By this reasoning
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose.
"Whereas a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found
"Whereas civets and other animals in the markets have been found to harbour viruses identical to SARS-CoV
"Pangolin beta-CoVs strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found
"Although questions remain
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
"Pervasive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV
"Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets
"By the same reasoning
"However
"On the other hand
"These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as a main source of meat
They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.
"It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS
"To stop the recurrent outbreaks of MERS
"As we are not able to eliminate these viruses
A variety of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
"Particularly
"There are plenty of opportunities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine
The culture of eating wild animals in some places of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
"With the ordeals of SARS
"In fact
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover.
"Although bats have many features that favours the spreading of viruses
"Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts
"To conclude
Several pieces in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
"First
"Second
"Third
"Finally
"Should it be a bat
"Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
"Low-molecular-weight heparin is being widely used to treat patients

"b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs
ACE2 counters the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases.ACE2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
"ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein
"The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase
"ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of mainly lung type II alveolar cells
"ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counter balance to ACE.
ACE cleaves angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting  angiotensin II.
"ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7)
"ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin
ACE2 also regulates the membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.
"As a transmembrane protein
"More specifically
"This entry process also requires priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2

The organisations declared eight conditions on governmental projects:
"surveillance would have to be ""lawful

the use of data would have to be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
data security and anonymity would have to be protected and shown to be protected based on evidence;
digital surveillance would have to avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties would have to be defined in law;
there would have to be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuses;

The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
"Macroscopy: pleurisy
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
"mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
"Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.
Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.
"The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public settings
Distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no medication known to be effective at preventing COVID-19.As a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest
"The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
"It further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol
"In these formulations
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antisepsis""."
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
"People are managed with supportive care
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.
"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.The WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID-19.
"Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource

"For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19
"The recommended gear is: PPE gown
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has authorised the masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect from airborne particles like dust but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label uses.
"When masks are not available
"Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives
"The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people in hospital
Whether either of these two leads to the same benefit for people who are critically ill is not known.
"Some doctors prefer staying with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high flow nasal cannula.Severe cases are most common in older adults (those older than 60 years
"Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita
"One study in China found 5% were admitted to intensive care units
"In China
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators capable of pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to maximise oxygen delivery while minimising the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
"Research into potential treatments started in January 2020
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.
"Although new medications may take until 2021 to develop
Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommended volunteers take part in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not undergone the clinical studies needed to show it is safe and effective for the disease.

Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have demonstrated that initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies without further study.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.

The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
"Generally this test is carried out on a nasopharyngeal swab though a throat swab may also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests
"As of 6 April 2020
In the US a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
"Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus
"A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect imaging features of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
"Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene
Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
"However
"This means that the virus is spreading within communities

The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin
"The WHO has recommended the wearing of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk
Several countries have started to encourage the use of face masks by members of the public.
"In the U.S.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places.

Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
"Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools
"Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.

"These include recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.

"Hand washing (or handwashing)
"Hand washing with soap consistently at certain ""critical moments"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases
"People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold
"The five critical moments during the day where washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation
"If water and soap are not available
"Before

Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
"The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria
"This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field
"Hand washing has many health benefits

This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50%.
"Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third
"48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap.Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI)
"Pneumonia
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million child deaths annually.
"According to UNICEF
"Hand washing is usually integrated together with other sanitation interventions as part of water
Hand washing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin.
"A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
"There are five critical times during the day where washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after using the bathroom (urination
"Other occasions when correct handwashing technique should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing
"In many countries

It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water.
"The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution
"Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins
"Cleansing is
"Solid soap
A small number of studies which have looked at the bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded transfer is unlikely as the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam.
"The CDC still states ""liquid soap with hands-free controls for dispensing is preferable""."
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public.
"To date
"However
"So
"Besides the surfactant and skin-protecting agent
Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
"However
"Contrary to popular belief however
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
"In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century
"Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel
Adding diluted hydrogen-peroxide increases further  the antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers.
"Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria
"Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction
"Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses
"The front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid
"Finger tips must be washed well too
"The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
"In clinical trials
"Allergic contact dermatitis
The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.
"Despite their effectiveness
"It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens
"Alcohol-free hand sanitizer efficacy is heavily dependent on the ingredients and formulation
"More recently
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
"Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
"Like soap
WHO recommended ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Correct handwashing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control  for prevention of transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
"Running water is recommended because standing basins may be contaminated
"Lather hands by rubbing them with a generous amount of soap
"Soap lifts germs from the skin
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
"Scrubbing creates friction
Rinse well under running water.
Rinsing in a basin can recontaminate hands.
Dry with a clean towel or allow to air dry.
"Wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated.The most commonly missed areas are the thumb
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish may harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep the hands from drying out; dry skin can lead to skin damage which can increase the risk for the transmission of infection.
"Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where tap-water and/or soap is not available e.g. pouring water from a hanging jerrycan or gourd with suitable holes and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries)
"A tippy-tap is a simple technology using a jug suspended by a rope
"Effective drying of the hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process
A growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms.
"In 2008
"After washing and drying hands with the warm-air dryer
Drying with the jet-air dryer resulted in an increase on average of the total number of bacteria on the finger pads by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
"After washing and drying hands with a paper towel
"The jet-air dryer
Use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
"Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.In 2005
The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:
"Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist
Hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative during traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand-washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study has found decreased infection rates with their use.
"Medical hand-washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds
Hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking.
"If there is debris under fingernails
"Since germs may remain in the water on the hands
"After drying
This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.
"The purpose of hand-washing in the health-care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (""germs"") and avoid transmitting them."
"The New England Journal of Medicine reports that a lack of hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments
One study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in health-care sectors.
The draft guidance of hand hygiene by the organization can also be found at its website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
"The World Health Organization has ""Five Moments"" for washing hands:"
after exposure to blood/body fluids
"before an aseptic task
"after patient care.The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (""medicated"" or ""antimicrobial"" soaps) confers killing action to a hand-washing agent."
"Such killing action may be desired prior to performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent.To 'scrub' one's hands for a surgical operation
All jewelry should be removed.
"This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow
Long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary.
"When rinsing
"After hand-washing is completed
"To reduce the spread of germs
"For control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals
Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap.Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
"But soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands.Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings can involve education for staff on hand washing
There is a need for more research into which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
"In developing countries
"However
"For example
"However
"The promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions
"For this to work effectively
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs
"When minimum standards are achieved
Building hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.
"Global Hand washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to achieve behavior change.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic
Few studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relationship to DALYs averted.
"However
"The importance of hand washing for human health – particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna
At that time most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasmas.
"In the 1980s
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
"For example
"The phrase ""washing one's hands of"" something
"It originates from the bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ
"In Shakespeare's Macbeth
"It has also been found that people
"Furthermore
"Religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes.Symbolic hand washing

Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard controls to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
"The proper hazard controls in the workplace depend on the worksite and job task
"According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
"Medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected with COVID-19
"This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools
"Hazard controls for this group
"OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high exposure risk
"Hazard controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects within the workplace.
"Workers may be absent from work due to becoming sick
"Patterns of commerce may change
"Lastly
"Plans address the levels of risk associated with various worksites and job tasks
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
"Objectives for response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff
The disease severity in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
"Where COVID-19 hazards cannot be eliminated
"Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
"Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls
"All types of PPE must be selected based upon the hazard to the worker
"According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
"Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing
"Prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are to stay home until they are free of fever
"According to OSHA
"These include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools
Workers in this risk group rarely require use of respirators.
"If a person becomes sick on an airplane
"Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when tending to a sick traveler or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces
"Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag
"Ideally
"When there is minimal to moderate community transmission
"When there is substantial transmission in the local community
"Law enforcement officials who must make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians
"If close contact occurs during apprehension
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high categories of exposure risk.
"High exposure risk jobs include healthcare delivery
"Aerosol-generating procedures include intubation
"High exposure risk mortuary jobs include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people who had known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high exposure risk if they perform an autopsy.Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with known or suspected COVID-19
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary settings.
Specimens should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case.In addition to other PPE
"In the United States
"Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.The WHO does not recommend coveralls
WHO recommends only a surgical mask for point-of-entry screening personnel.

Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
"At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)
"These data were used for assessing the trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and the UK
"As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases
We also presented the cumulative number of notified cases of each country as at 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with that of Italy for the 31 January–15 March 2020 period.
Trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
"For the EU/EEA and the UK overall

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
"Through transmission electron microscopy

"However
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.

"According to a study
"However
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
"It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and hence is susceptible to the novel virus.

Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The collection of the blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from catching the disease has a long history.
"Indeed
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
"Based on this
"Their symptoms improved within 24 hours
"However
"In addition
"For example
"The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly enough to fight against a global epidemic.
"Thus
"This way
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
"However
Most of the effective components remain unknown or are vague as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
"Currently
"For example
"Top cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients
"However
"On February 18
"They found that the times needed for body temperature recovery

"Nevertheless
It would also be intriguing to characterize the mechanism of actions and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
"Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mostly experience great fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease
"Furthermore
"In the early phase of the SARS outbreak
"Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine
"Thus
"The psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
This is probably because SARS died down 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
"In contrast
"Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using inactivated virus
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the ongoing epidemic.
"However
"As a novel disease
"In most cases
"However
"Therefore
"Based on clinical studies reported thus far
"Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS
"COVID-19 mainly happened at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients being over 50 in a study of 8
"Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (at the median age of 66 versus 51)
"Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100
"Without knowing answers to #1 and 2
"Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2
Does the virus also bind ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
"Without clear answers to these questions
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission among humans?
"Will it become a pandemic worldwide
It is essential but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
"However
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
"Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts
"Before 2003
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well.
Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans.
"In this review
"Importantly
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
"In addition
"Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae
These viruses harbouring the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases amongst RNA viruses were termed “CoVs” because of their crown-like morphology under electron microscope.
"Structurally
"Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b)
"The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins
"The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for the structural proteins
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
"Based on the difference in protein sequences
"Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs
"For thousands of years
"To date
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
"The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43
"HCoV-229E
"In contrast
"The first HCoV-229E strain
"Since then
"Indeed
"The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history
"Ten years later
"The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV)
The alarm has been ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
"All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin from bats
"Multiple lines of evidence support an evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats
"The COVID-19 epidemic has presented enormous medical
"Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the natural history
"In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins
"Particularly
We also review the trend of HCoV evolution in which the increase in transmissibility often comes with the decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since late 1930s.
"Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of patients who had contracted common cold
"In the past decades
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table ​1) would be informative and instructive.
"The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the year of 1966
"Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented with common cold symptoms
"Later in 1967
"The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E
"Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally
"Generally
"According to a human volunteer study
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
"SARS
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
"The SARS epidemic resulted in 8
"Apart from the super-spreaders
"Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia
"Lymphopenia
"Diffuse alveolar damage
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
"In addition to lower respiratory tract
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
"Since then
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands during late 2004.
"It was initially found to be prevalent in young children
"Presentation of coryza
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen from an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
"Although it was identified in Netherlands
"It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases
"HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis
"In the same year
"Besides community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis
"Similar to HCoV-NL63
"All these four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases
"Generally
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
"Whereas most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
"Clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS
"Unlike SARS
"More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms
"As of February 14
"During middle to late December 2019
World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
"As of March 3
"Notably
"SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and might contribute to its rapid spreading around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.
"First
"In this regard
"Second
"On one hand
"On the other hand
"Third
"On one hand
"On the other hand
"Finally
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
"Nevertheless
All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
"From another perspective
"In other words
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
"For this to happen
"In this sense
"If it adapts well
"For many years
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
"In contrast
"They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
"It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs
"However
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
"Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
"Likewise
"In both cases
"In contrast
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain its transmission within the intermediate host.
"On the contrary
"In this case
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the index case of SARS had a contact history with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared with that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all civets in the markets.
"However
"Notably
All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.
"Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV unveiled a closely related bat CoV
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging human pathogens.
"Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
"WIV1 derived from fecal sample of bats was demonstrated to use bat
"Intriguingly
"Thus far
"Albeit the high homology between these two viruses
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
"Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
"Up to now
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
"Thus
"On the other hand
"Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels
It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
"Notably
"However
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
"As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
"That is to say
"Presumably
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
"However
"They cluster into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree
"In stark contrast
"An earlier study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples
This study adopted different assembly methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
This is one line of scientific research which is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Analyzing those binding sites provide the reasonable project of developing effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.

The half-life of rhACE2 in human beings is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated.Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
"While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms
"While these droplets are produced when breathing out
"People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
"It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
"Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary
"Currently
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
"Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever
"Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing
"Less commonly
"Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea
Some cases in China initially presented only with chest tightness and palpitations.
"In some
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all who are infected develop symptoms.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Loud talking releases more droplets than normal talking.
A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolised and thus result in airborne spread.
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads

"This
"Soap and detergent are also effective if correctly used; soap products degrade the virus' fatty protective layer
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
"In those most severely affected
"Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis

Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung picture resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
"In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China
"According to March data from the United States
"Estimates of the mortality from the condition vary because of those regional differences

The under-counting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
"However
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
"The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease
This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.

"Immunity is seen as likely
These cases are believed to be worsening of a lingering infection rather than re-infection.
"The virus is thought to be natural and have an animal origin
"The actual origin is unknown
"A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19
Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
"These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing
"In late 2019
"Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics
"The number varies by region.Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR)

"A study published on 16 March found that in China
A statistical analysis published 30 March estimated that numbers of infections in Italy were considerably greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
"For those who do not
"As of 10 April 2020
"In China
"The number of true fatalities from COVID-19 may be much higher
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death tally by a factor of 4-5x.
The number varies by region.
These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
"The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results from the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany
The WHO asserts that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
"According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated
The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
"Less common symptoms include fatigue
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing
"Some of those infected may be asymptomatic
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from few to 44%.
"The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days.As an example of uncertainty
Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined.
"The disease is believed to be primarily spread during close contact and by small droplets produced during coughing
Studies have found that an uncovered coughing can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
"Some have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that stay for more prolonged periods in the air
The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolized and thus result in airborne spread.
"It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface
"While there are concerns it may spread by faeces
"The Government of China denied the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before onset of symptoms suggesting transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
"Only few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads
"Specifically
"This
"There is no evidence animals can pass the virus on to humans
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus
"All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.Outside the human body
"When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.
"Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak
This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
"Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
"South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines
Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.
"Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half
"Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
"There are no specific antiviral medications approved for COVID-19
"Taking over-the-counter cold medications
"Depending on the severity
The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.
Several compounds that were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.
"The WHO also stated that some ""traditional and home remedies"" can provide relief of the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19."
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
There are various theories about where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
"The first known case of the novel coronavirus may trace back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan
