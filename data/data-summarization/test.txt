10.1002/14651858.CD001290.pub2	A total of 38 studies involving 7843 children were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001290.pub2	Following educational intervention delivered to children, their parents or both, there was a significantly reduced risk of subsequent emergency department visits (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.81, N = 3008) and hospital admissions (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92, N = 4019) compared with control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001290.pub2	There were also fewer unscheduled doctor visits (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.81, N = 1009).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001290.pub2	Very few data were available for other outcomes (FEV1, PEF, rescue medication use, quality of life or symptoms) and there was no statistically significant difference between education and control.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001290.pub2	Asthma education aimed at children and their carers who present to the emergency department for acute exacerbations can result in lower risk of future emergency department presentation and hospital admission.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001290.pub2	There remains uncertainty as to the long-term effect of education on other markers of asthma morbidity such as quality of life, symptoms and lung function.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001290.pub2	It remains unclear as to what type, duration and intensity of educational packages are the most effective in reducing acute care utilisation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	We included 130 studies with 8341 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Ketamine was given to 4588 participants and 3753 participants served as controls.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Types of surgery included ear, nose or throat surgery, wisdom tooth extraction, thoracotomy, lumbar fusion surgery, microdiscectomy, hip joint replacement surgery, knee joint replacement surgery, anterior cruciate ligament repair, knee arthroscopy, mastectomy, haemorrhoidectomy, abdominal surgery, radical prostatectomy, thyroid surgery, elective caesarean section, and laparoscopic surgery.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Racemic ketamine bolus doses were predominantly 0.25 mg to 1 mg, and infusions 2 to 5 µg/kg/minute; 10 studies used only S-ketamine and one only R-ketamine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Risk of bias was generally low or uncertain, except for study size; most had fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm, resulting in high heterogeneity, as expected, for most analyses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	We did not stratify the main analysis by type of surgery or any other factor, such as dose or timing of ketamine administration, and used a non-stratified analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced postoperative opioid consumption over 24 hours by 8 mg morphine equivalents (95% CI 6 to 9; 19% from 42 mg consumed by participants given placebo, moderate-quality evidence; 65 studies, 4004 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Over 48 hours, opioid consumption was 13 mg lower (95% CI 10 to 15; 19% from 67 mg with placebo, moderate-quality evidence; 37 studies, 2449 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced pain at rest at 24 hours by 5/100 mm on a visual analogue scale (95% CI 4 to 7; 19% lower from 26/100 mm with placebo, high-quality evidence; 82 studies, 5004 participants), and at 48 hours by 5/100 mm (95% CI 3 to 7; 22% lower from 23/100 mm, high-quality evidence; 49 studies, 2962 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Pain during movement was reduced at 24 hours (6/100 mm, 14% lower from 42/100 mm, moderate-quality evidence; 29 studies, 1806 participants), and 48 hours (6/100 mm, 16% lower from 37 mm, low-quality evidence; 23 studies, 1353 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Results for primary outcomes were consistent when analysed by pain at rest or on movement, operation type, and timing of administration, or sensitivity to study size and pain intensity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	No analysis by dose was possible.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	There was no difference when nitrous oxide was used.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	We downgraded the quality of the evidence once if numbers of participants were large but small-study effects were present, or twice if numbers were small and small-study effects likely but testing not possible.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Ketamine increased the time for the first postoperative analgesic request by 54 minutes (95% CI 37 to 71 minutes), from a mean of 39 minutes with placebo (moderate-quality evidence; 31 studies, 1678 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Ketamine reduced the area of postoperative hyperalgesia by 7 cm² (95% CI −11.9 to −2.2), compared with placebo (very low-quality evidence; 7 studies 333 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	We downgraded the quality of evidence because of small-study effects or because the number of participants was below 400.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	CNS adverse events occurred in 52 studies, while 53 studies reported of absence of CNS adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Overall, 187/3614 (5%) participants receiving ketamine and 122/2924 (4%) receiving control treatment experienced an adverse event (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.4; high-quality evidence; 105 studies, 6538 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Ketamine reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting from 27% with placebo to 23% with ketamine (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96; the number needed to treat to prevent one episode of postoperative nausea and vomiting with perioperative intravenous ketamine administration was 24 (95% CI 16 to 54; high-quality evidence; 95 studies, 5965 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative analgesic consumption and pain intensity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Results were consistent in different operation types or timing of ketamine administration, with larger and smaller studies, and by higher and lower pain intensity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	CNS adverse events were little different with ketamine or control.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4	Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting by a small extent, of arguable clinical relevance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006199	Five trials of MSP/RESA vaccine with 217 participants were included; all five reported on safety, and two on efficacy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006199	No severe or systemic adverse effects were reported at doses of 13 to 15 µg of each antigen (39 to 45 µg total).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006199	One small efficacy trial with 17 non-immune participants with blood-stage parasites showed no reduction or delay in parasite growth rates after artificial challenge.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006199	In the second efficacy trial in 120 children aged five to nine years in Papua New Guinea, episodes of clinical malaria were not reduced, but MSP/RESA significantly reduced parasite density only in children who had not been pretreated with an antimalarial drug (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006199	Infections with the 3D7 parasite subtype of MSP2 (the variant included in the vaccine) were reduced (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.57; 719 participants) while those with the other main subtype, FC27, were not (720 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006199	The MSP/RESA (Combination B) vaccine shows promise as a way to reduce the severity of malaria episodes, but the effect of the vaccine is MSP2 variant-specific.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006199	Pretreatment for malaria during a vaccine trial makes the results difficult to interpret, particularly with the relatively small sample sizes of early trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006199	The results show that blood-stage vaccines may play a role and merit further development.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	Four studies, involving 125 participants, were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	Three studies evaluated the effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields and one study, capacitive coupled electric fields.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	Participants with delayed union and non-union of the long bones were included, but most data related to non-union of the tibia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	Although all studies were blinded randomised placebo-controlled trials, each study had limitations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	The primary measure of the clinical effectiveness of electromagnetic field stimulation was the proportion of participants whose fractures had united at a fixed time point.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	The overall pooled effect size was small and not statistically significant (risk ratio 1.96; 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 4.48; 4 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	There was substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity in this pooled analysis (I2 = 58%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	A sensitivity analysis conducted to determine the effect of multiple follow-up time-points on the heterogeneity amongst the studies showed that the effect size remained non-significant at 24 weeks (risk ratio 1.61; 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 3.54; 3 trials), with similar heterogeneity (I2 = 57%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	There was no reduction in pain found in two trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	No study reported functional outcome measures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	One trial reported two minor complications resulting from treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	Though the available evidence suggests that electromagnetic field stimulation may offer some benefit in the treatment of delayed union and non-union of long bone fractures, it is inconclusive and insufficient to inform current practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008471.pub2	More definitive conclusions on treatment effect await further well-conducted randomised controlled trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	A total of 1831 participants were randomised to drain (915 participants) versus 'no drain' (916 participants) in 12 trials included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	Only two trials including 199 participants were of low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	Nine trials included patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy exclusively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	One trial included patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis exclusively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	One trial included patients undergoing elective and emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and one trial did not provide this information.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	The average age of participants in the trials ranged between 48 years and 63 years in the 10 trials that provided this information.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	The proportion of females ranged between 55.0% and 79.0% in the 11 trials that provided this information.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	There was no significant difference between the drain group (1/840) (adjusted proportion: 0.1%) and the 'no drain' group (2/841) (0.2%) (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.04 to 4.37) in short-term mortality in the ten trials with 1681 participants reporting on this outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	There was no significant difference between the drain group (7/567) (adjusted proportion: 1.1%) and the 'no drain' group (3/576) (0.5%) in the proportion of patients who developed serious adverse events in the seven trials with 1143 participants reporting on this outcome (RR 2.12; 95% CI 0.67 to 7.40) or in the number of serious adverse events in each group reported by eight trials with 1286 participants; drain group (12/646) (adjusted rate: 1.5 events per 100 participants) versus 'no drain' group (6/640) (0.9 events per 100 participants); rate ratio 1.60; 95% CI 0.66 to 3.87).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	There was no significant difference in the quality of life between the two groups (one trial; 93 participants; SMD 0.22; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.63).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	The proportion of patients who were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy seemed significantly lower in the drain group than the 'no drain' group (one trial; 68 participants; drain group (0/33) (adjusted proportion: 0.2%) versus 'no drain' group (11/35) (31.4%); RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.75).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups (five trials; 449 participants; MD 0.22 days; 95% CI -0.06 days to 0.51 days).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	The operating time was significantly longer in the drain group than the 'no drain' group (seven trials; 775 participants; MD 5.00 minutes; 95% CI 2.69 minutes to 7.30 minutes).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	There was no significant difference in the return to normal activity and return to work between the groups in one trial involving 100 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	This trial did not provide any information from which the standard deviation could be imputed and so the confidence intervals could not be calculated for these outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	There is currently no evidence to support the routine use of drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006004.pub4	Further well designed randomised clinical trials are necessary.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	Forty-nine randomised trials involving 3639 participants were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	All trials were conducted and published in China.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	Thirty-eight different herbal medicines were tested in these trials, including four single herbs (extracts from a single herb), eight traditional Chinese patent medicines, and 26 self concocted Chinese herbal compound prescriptions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	The trials reported on global symptom improvement (including improvement in numbness or pain) and changes in nerve conduction velocity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	The positive results described from the 49 studies of low quality are of questionable significance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	There was inadequate reporting on adverse events in the included trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	Eighteen trials found no adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	Two trials reported adverse events: adverse events occurred in the control group in one trial, and in the other it was unclear in which group the adverse events occurred.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	29 trials did not mention whether they monitored adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	Conclusions cannot be drawn from this review about the safety of herbal medicines, due to inadequate reporting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	Most of the trials were of very low methodological quality and therefore the interpretation of any positive findings for the efficacy of the included Chinese herbal medicines for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy should be made with caution.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	Based on this systematic review, there is no evidence to support the objective effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicines for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007796.pub3	No well-designed, randomised, placebo controlled trial with objective outcome measures has been conducted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	Five randomized studies involving 1382 patients were included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer, had relatively small populations, and were of short duration.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	Few events were reported and did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	Only one study (N = 77) evaluated biochemical outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	A subgroup analysis found no significant differences in biochemical progression (defined by the authors as PSA ≥ 10 ng/mL) between IAS and CAS for Gleason scores 4 - 6, 7, and 8 - 10.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	For patients with a Gleason score > 6, reduction in biochemical progression favoured the IAS group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, P = 0.02).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	Studies primarily reported on adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	One trial (N = 43) found no difference in adverse effects (gastrointestinal, gynecomastia and asthenia) between IAS ( two events) and CAS (five events), with the exception of impotence, which was significantly lower in the IAS group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92, P = 0.008).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	Data from RCTs comparing IAS to CAS are limited by small sample size and short duration.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	There are no data for the relative effectiveness of IAS versus CAS for overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, or disease progression.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	Limited information suggests	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	IAS may have slightly reduced adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005009.pub2	Overall, IAS was also as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	We identified 12 trials most of which are of moderate risk of bias involving 7,119 participants which described random assignment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	Five trials randomised to either immediate or delayed insertion of IUD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	One of them randomised to immediate versus delayed insertion of Copper 7 showed immediate insertion of the Copper 7 was associated with a higher risk of expulsion than was delayed insertion (RR 11.98, 95% CI 1.61 to 89.35,1 study, 259 participants); the quality of evidence was moderate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	Moderate quality of evidence also suggests that use and expulsion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or CuT380A was more likely for immediate compared to delayed insertion risk ratio (RR) 1.40 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.58; 3 studies; 878 participants) and RR 2.64 ( 95% CI 1.16 to 6.00; 3 studies; 878 participants) respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	Another trial randomised to the levonorgestrel IUD or Nova T showed discontinuation rates due to pregnancy were likely to be higher for women in the Nova T group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	(MD 8.70, 95% CI 3.92 to 13.48;1 study; 438 participants); moderate quality evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	Seven trials examined immediate insertion of IUD only.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	From meta-analysis of two multicentre trials, pregnancy was less likely for the TCu 220C versus the Lippes Loop (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.75; 2 studies; 2257 participants ) as was expulsion (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.81; 2 studies; 2257 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	Estimates for the TCu 220 versus the Copper 7 were RR 0.42 ( 95% CI 0.23 to 0.77; 2 studies, 2,274 participants) and RR 0.68, (95% CI 0.51 to 0.91); 2 studies, 2,274 participants), respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	In other work, adding copper sleeves to the Lippes Loop improved efficacy (RR 3.40, 95% CI 1.28 to 9.04, 1 study, 400 participants) and reduced expulsion (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.51 to 5.97; 1 study, 400 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	Moderate quality evidence shows that insertion of an IUD immediately after abortion is safe and practical.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	IUD expulsion rates appear higher immediately after abortions compared to delayed insertions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001777.pub4	However, at six months postabortion, IUD use is higher following immediate insertion compared to delayed insertion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	We included only one small trial published as an abstract article.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	The included study investigated the effects of meditation practice on patients newly hospitalised with acute leukaemia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	Ninety-one participants enrolled in the study, but only 42 participants remained in the trial throughout the six-month follow-up period and were eligible for analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	There was no information provided about the average age and sex of the study population.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	We found a high risk for attrition bias and unclear risk for reporting bias, performance and detection bias because of missing data due to abstract publication only, thus we judged the overall risk of bias as high.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	According to the GRADE criteria, we judged the overall quality of the body of evidence for all predefined outcomes as 'very low', due to the extent of missing data on the study population, and the small sample size.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	As the abstract publication did not provide numbers and results except P values, we are not able to give more details.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	Meditation practice might be beneficial for the quality of life of haematologically-diseased patients, with higher scores for participants in the mediation arms compared to the participants in the usual care control group (low quality of evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	Levels of depression decreased for those practising meditation in both the spiritually-framed meditation group and the secularly-focused meditation group in comparison to the usual care control group, whose levels of depression remained constant (low quality of evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	The influence of meditation practice on overall survival, fatigue, anxiety, quality of sleep and adverse events remained unclear, as these outcomes were not evaluated in the included trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	To estimate the effects of meditation practice for patients suffering from haematological malignancies, more high quality randomised controlled trials are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2	At present there is not enough information available on the effects of meditation in haematologically-diseased patients to draw any conclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001833.pub3	We identified three trials involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001833.pub3	The included trials varied in study quality, vaccine used, length of follow-up and outcomes measured and, as such, were not suitable for meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001833.pub3	We identified high or unclear risk of bias in two of the three included studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001833.pub3	Overall, 13 out of 56 vaccine recipients (23%) developed varicella compared with 42 out of 54 placebo (or no vaccine) recipients (78%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001833.pub3	Of the vaccine recipients who developed varicella, the majority only had mild disease (with fewer than 50 skin lesions).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001833.pub3	In the three trials, most participants received PEP within three days following exposure; too few participants were vaccinated four to five days post-exposure to ascertain the efficacy of vaccine given more than three days after exposure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001833.pub3	No included trial reported on adverse events following immunisation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001833.pub3	These small trials suggest varicella vaccine administered within three days to children following household contact with a varicella case reduces infection rates and severity of cases.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001833.pub3	We identified no RCTs for adolescents or adults.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001833.pub3	Safety was not adequately addressed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	We included 12 RCTs, with 4704 participants, in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	Eleven trials performed a total of 16 head-to-head comparisons of different prophylactic antibiotic regimens.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	Antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis in one trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	All the trials were at high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	With the exception of one trial in which all the participants were positive for nasal carriage of MRSA or had had previous MRSA infections, it does not appear that MRSA was tested or eradicated prior to surgery; nor does it appear that there was high prevalence of MRSA carrier status in the people undergoing surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	There was no sufficient clinical similarity between the trials to perform a meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	The overall all-cause mortality in four trials that reported mortality was 14/1401 (1.0%) and there were no significant differences in mortality between the intervention and control groups in each of the individual comparisons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	There were no antibiotic-related serious adverse events in any of the 561 people randomised to the seven different antibiotic regimens in four trials (three trials that reported mortality and one other trial).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	None of the trials reported quality of life, total length of hospital stay or the use of healthcare resources.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	Overall, 221/4032 (5.5%) people developed SSIs due to all organisms, and 46/4704 (1.0%) people developed SSIs due to MRSA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	In the 15 comparisons that compared one antibiotic regimen with another, there were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed SSIs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	In the single trial that compared an antibiotic regimen with placebo, the proportion of people who developed SSIs was significantly lower in the group that received antibiotic prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav (or cefotaxime if allergic to penicillin) compared with placebo (all SSI: RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.65; MRSA SSI RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.83).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	In two trials that reported MRSA infections other than SSI, 19/478 (4.5%) people developed MRSA infections including SSI, chest infection and bacteraemia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	There were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed MRSA infections at any body site in these two comparisons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	Prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav decreases the proportion of people developing MRSA infections compared with placebo in people without malignant disease undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion, although this may be due to decreasing overall infection thereby preventing wounds from becoming secondarily infected with MRSA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	There is currently no other evidence to suggest that using a combination of multiple prophylactic antibiotics or administering prophylactic antibiotics for an increased duration is of benefit to people undergoing surgery in terms of reducing MRSA infections.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010268.pub2	Well designed RCTs assessing the clinical effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens are necessary on this topic.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	We included two trials (116 women) comparing planned home versus hospital management for PPROM.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	Overall, the number of included women in each trial was too small to allow adequate assessment of pre-specified outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	Investigators used strict inclusion criteria and in both studies relatively few of the women presenting with PPROM were eligible for inclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	Women were monitored for 48 to 72 hours before randomisation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	Perinatal mortality was reported in one trial and there was insufficient evidence to determine whether it differed between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 20.05).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	There was no evidence of differences between groups for serious neonatal morbidity, chorioamnionitis, gestational age at delivery, birthweight and admission to neonatal intensive care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	There was no information on serious maternal morbidity or mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	There was some evidence that women managed in hospital were more likely to be delivered by caesarean section (RR (random-effects) 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.15).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	However, results should be interpreted cautiously as there is moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 35%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	Mothers randomised to care at home spent approximately 10 fewer days as inpatients (mean difference -9.60, 95% CI -14.59 to -4.61) and were more satisfied with their care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	Furthermore, home care was associated with reduced costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	The review included two relatively small studies that did not have sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences between groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	Future large and adequately powered randomised controlled trials are required to measure differences between groups for relevant pre-specified outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3	Special attention should be given to the assessment of maternal satisfaction with care and cost analysis as they will have social and economic implications in both developed and developing countries.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003577.pub3	The two methods of skin closure for caesarean that have been most often compared are non-absorbable staples and absorbable subcutaneous sutures.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003577.pub3	Compared with absorbable subcutaneous sutures, non-absorbable staples are associated with similar incidences of wound infection.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003577.pub3	Other important secondary outcomes, such as wound complications, were also similar between the groups in women with Pfannenstiel incisions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003577.pub3	However, it is important to note, that for both of these outcomes (wound infection and wound complication), staples may have a differential effect depending on the type of skin incision, i.e., Pfannenstiel or vertical.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003577.pub3	Compared with absorbable subcutaneous sutures, non-absorbable staples are associated with an increased risk of skin separation, and therefore, reclosure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003577.pub3	However, skin separation was variably defined across trials, and most staples were removed before four days postpartum.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003577.pub3	There is currently no conclusive evidence about how the skin should be closed after caesarean section.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003577.pub3	Staples are associated with similar outcomes in terms of wound infection, pain and cosmesis compared with sutures, and these two are the most commonly studied methods for skin closure after caesarean section.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003577.pub3	If staples are removed on day three, there is an increased incidence of skin separation and the need for reclosure compared with absorbable sutures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	We identified 11 RCTs with a total of 821 participants, two trials awaiting classification and one ongoing trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	Seven trials examined a green tea intervention and four examined a black tea intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	Dosage and form of both green and black tea differed between trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	The ongoing trial is examining the effects of green tea powder capsules.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	No studies reported cardiovascular events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	Black tea was found to produce statistically significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mean difference (MD) -0.43 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.31) and blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP): MD -1.85 mmHg, 95% CI -3.21 to -0.48.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	Diastolic blood pressure (DBP): MD -1.27 mmHg, 95% CI -3.06 to 0.53) over six months, stable to sensitivity analysis, but only a small number of trials contributed to each analysis and studies were at risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	Green tea was also found to produce statistically significant reductions in total cholesterol (MD -0.62 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.46), LDL cholesterol (MD -0.64 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.52) and blood pressure (SBP: MD -3.18 mmHg, 95% CI -5.25 to -1.11; DBP: MD -3.42, 95% CI -4.54 to -2.30), but only a small number of studies contributed to each analysis, and results were not stable to sensitivity analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	When both tea types were analysed together they showed favourable effects on LDL cholesterol (MD -0.48 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.35) and blood pressure (SBP: MD -2.25 mmHg, 95% CI -3.39 to -1.11; DBP: MD -2.81 mmHg, 95% CI -3.77 to -1.86).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	Adverse events were measured in five trials and included a diagnosis of prostate cancer, hospitalisation for influenza, appendicitis and retinal detachment but these are unlikely to be directly attributable to the intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	There are very few long-term studies to date examining green or black tea for the primary prevention of CVD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2	The limited evidence suggests that tea has favourable effects on CVD risk factors, but due to the small number of trials contributing to each analysis the results should be treated with some caution and further high quality trials with longer-term follow-up are needed to confirm this.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003270.pub2	Two small trials recruiting 23 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003270.pub2	Participants may have been suffering from comorbid lung disease.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003270.pub2	No data on oral steroid consumption were reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003270.pub2	No significant differences were observed in the studies for FEV1, FVC, PaO2 and symptoms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003270.pub2	One study reported a statistically significant difference in SGaw, but the clinical importance of this is uncertain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003270.pub2	Due to concerns over the small sample sizes and methodological shortcomings in terms of inadequate washout in one study, and methods used in outcome assessment for both studies, the findings of the studies are not generalisable to the issue of steroid tapering.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003270.pub2	An update search conducted in August 2010 did not identify any new studies for consideration in the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003270.pub2	Currently there is a clear lack of evidence to support the use of azathioprine in the treatment of chronic asthma as a steroid sparing-agent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003270.pub2	Large, long-term studies with pre-defined steroid reducing protocols are required before recommendations for clinical practice can be made.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006145.pub3	For this update we identified a total of 56 studies (4068 participants) for inclusion (28 from the original search and 28 from the updated search), with the majority carried out in participants with breast cancer (28 studies).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006145.pub3	A meta-analysis of all fatigue data, incorporating 38 comparisons, provided data for 1461 participants who received an exercise intervention and 1187 control participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006145.pub3	At the end of the intervention period exercise was seen to be statistically more effective than the control intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to -0.17).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006145.pub3	Benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed for interventions delivered during or post-adjuvant cancer therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006145.pub3	In relation to diagnosis, we identified benefits of exercise on fatigue for breast and prostate cancer but not for those with haematological malignancies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006145.pub3	Finally, aerobic exercise significantly reduced fatigue but resistance training and alternative forms of exercise failed to reach significance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006145.pub3	The findings of the updated review have enabled a more precise conclusion to be made in that aerobic exercise can be regarded as beneficial for individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy, specifically those with solid tumours.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006145.pub3	Further research is required to determine the optimal type, intensity and timing of an exercise intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	We screened 1796 records and identified five eligible trials in total i.e. one trial could be added on the previous review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	These trials included only adults (16 to 65 years of age).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	We included all five trials with 3427 people in the meta-analyses: the HD9 and HD14 trials were co-ordinated in Germany, the HD2000 and GSM-HD trials were performed in Italy and the EORTC 20012 was conducted in Belgium.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	The overall risk of performance and detection bias was low for overall survival (OS), but was high for other outcomes, as therapy blinding was not feasible.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	The remaining 'Risk of bias' domains were low and unclear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	All trials reported results for OS and progression-free survival (PFS).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	In contrast to the our first published review (2011) the addition of results from the EORTC 20012 BEACOPP escalated increases OS (3142 participants; HR 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.97; high-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	This means that only 90 (70 to 117) patients will die after five years in the BEACOPP escalated arm compared to 120 in the ABVD arm.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	This survival advantage is also reflected in an increased PFS with BEACOPP escalated (3142 participants; HR 0.54 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.64); moderate-quality evidence), meaning that after five years only 144 (121 to 168) patients will experience a progress, relapse or death in the BEACOPP escalated arm compared to 250 in the ABVD arm.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	There is no evidence for a difference for treatment-related mortality (2700 participants, RR 2.15 (95% CI = 0.93 to 4.95), low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	Although the occurrence of MDS or AML may increase with BEACOPP escalated (3332 participants, RR 3.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 11.21); low-quality evidence)), there is no evidence for a difference between both regimens for overall secondary malignancies (3332 participants, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.48), low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	However, the observation time of the studies included in the review is too short to be expected to demonstrate differences with respect to second solid tumours which would not be expected to show significance until around 15 years after treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	We are very uncertain how many female patients will be infertile due to chemotherapy and which arm might be favoured (106 participants, RR 1.37 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.26), very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	This is a very small sample, and the age of the patients was not detailed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	No analysis of male fertility was provided.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	Five trials reported adverse events and the analysis shows that the escalated BEACOPP regimens probably causes more haematological toxicities WHO grade III or IV ((anaemia: 2425 participants, RR 10.67 (95% CI 7.14 to 15.93); neutropenia: 519 participants, RR 1.80 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.13); thrombocytopenia: 2425 participants, RR 18.12 (95% CI 11.77 to 27.92); infections: 2425 participants, RR 3.73 (95% CI 2.58 to 5.38), all low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	Only one trial (EORTC 20012) planned to assess quality of life, however, no results were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	This meta-analysis provides moderate- to high-quality evidence that adult patients between 16 and 60 years of age with early unfavourable and advanced stage HL benefit regarding OS and PFS from first-line chemotherapy including escalated BEACOPP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	The proven benefit in OS for patients with advanced HL is a new finding of this updated review due to the inclusion of the results from the EORTC 20012 trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	Furthermore, there is only low-quality evidence of a difference in the total number of secondary malignancies, as the follow-up period might be too short to detect meaningful differences.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	Low-quality evidence also suggests that people treated with escalated BEACOPP may have a higher risk to develop secondary AML or MDS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	Due to the availability of only very low-quality evidence available, we are unable to come to a conclusion in terms of infertility.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	This review does for the first time suggest a survival benefit.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3	However, it is clear from this review that BEACOPP escalated may be more toxic that ABVD, and very important long-term side effects of second malignancies and infertility have not been sufficiently analysed yet.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	Fifteen RCTs including 1835 cancer patients met the inclusion criteria and because of multiple arms studies we included 19 evaluations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	We judged six studies to have a high risk of bias and nine to have a low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	All included studies were conducted in high income countries and most studies were aimed at breast cancer patients (seven trials) or prostate cancer patients (two trials).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	Two studies involved psycho-educational interventions including patient education and teaching self-care behaviours.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	Results indicated low quality evidence of similar RTW rates for psycho-educational interventions compared to care as usual (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.35, n = 260 patients) and low quality evidence that there is no difference in the effect of psycho-educational interventions compared to care as usual on quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.05, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.3, n = 260 patients).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	We did not find any studies on vocational interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	In one study breast cancer patients were offered a physical training programme.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	Low quality evidence suggested that physical training was not more effective than care as usual in improving RTW (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.32 to 4.54, n = 28 patients) or quality of life (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.99 to 0.25, n = 41 patients).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	Seven RCTs assessed the effects of a medical intervention on RTW.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	In all studies a less radical or functioning conserving medical intervention was compared with a more radical treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	We found low quality evidence that less radical, functioning conserving approaches had similar RTW rates as more radical treatments (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09, n = 1097 patients) and moderate quality evidence of no differences in quality of life outcomes (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.23, n = 1028 patients).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	Five RCTs involved multidisciplinary interventions in which vocational counselling, patient education, patient counselling, biofeedback-assisted behavioral training and/or physical exercises were combined.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	Moderate quality evidence showed that multidisciplinary interventions involving physical, psycho-educational and/or vocational components led to higher RTW rates than care as usual (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16, n = 450 patients).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	We found no differences in the effect of multidisciplinary interventions compared to care as usual on quality of life outcomes (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.25, n = 316 patients).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007569.pub3	We found moderate quality evidence that multidisciplinary interventions enhance the RTW of patients with cancer.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	We included no new trials in this update.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	We included four trials involving more than 13,000 women which were conducted in the UK and Ireland and included women in labour.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	Three trials were funded by the hospitals where the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	No declarations of interest were made in two trials; the remaining two trials did not mention declarations of interest.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	Overall, the studies were assessed as low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	Results reported in the 2012 review remain unchanged.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	Although not statistically significant using a strict P < 0.05 criterion, data were consistent with women allocated to admission CTG having, on average, a higher probability of an increase in incidence of caesarean section than women allocated to intermittent auscultation (risk ratio (RR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.44, 4 trials, 11,338 women, I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	There was no clear difference in the average treatment effect across included trials between women allocated to admission CTG and women allocated to intermittent auscultation in instrumental vaginal birth (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.27, 4 trials, 11,338 women, I² = 38%, low quality evidence) and perinatal mortality rate (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.47, 4 trials, 11,339 infants, I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	Women allocated to admission CTG had, on average, higher rates of continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.48, 3 trials, 10,753 women, I² = 79%, low quality evidence) and fetal blood sampling (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.45, 3 trials, 10,757 women, I² = 0%) than women allocated to intermittent auscultation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	There were no differences between groups in other secondary outcome measures including incidence and severity of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (incidence only reported) (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.90; 2367 infants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence) and incidence of seizures in the neonatal period (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.61; 8056 infants; 1 trial; low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	There were no data reported for severe neurodevelopmental disability assessed at greater than, or equal to, 12 months of age.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	Contrary to continued use in some clinical areas, we found no evidence of benefit for the use of the admission CTG for low-risk women on admission in labour.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	Furthermore, the probability is that admission CTG increases the caesarean section rate by approximately 20%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	The data lacked power to detect possible important differences in perinatal mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	However, it is unlikely that any trial, or meta-analysis, will be adequately powered to detect such differences.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	The findings of this review support recommendations that the admission CTG not be used for women who are low risk on admission in labour.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	Women should be informed that admission CTG is likely associated with an increase in the incidence of caesarean section without evidence of benefit.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	Evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency and a lack of blinding for participants and personnel.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	All four included trials were conducted in developed Western European countries.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	One additional study is ongoing.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	The usefulness of the findings of this review for developing countries will depend on FHR monitoring practices.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	However, an absence of benefit and likely harm associated with admission CTG will have relevance for countries where questions are being asked about the role of the admission CTG.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	Future studies evaluating the effects of the admission CTG should consider including women admitted with signs of labour and before a formal diagnosis of labour.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005122.pub5	This would include a cohort of women currently having admission CTGs and not included in current trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	We included 32 studies in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	Seventeen studies randomised women (total 3666), three randomised cycles (total 1018) and twelve randomised oocytes (over 15,230).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	It was not possible to pool any of the data because each study compared different culture media.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	Only seven studies reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	Four of these studies found no evidence of a difference between the media compared, for either day three or day five embryo transfer.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	The data from the fifth study did not appear reliable.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	Six studies reported clinical pregnancy rate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	One of these found a difference between the media compared, suggesting that for cleavage-stage embryo transfer, Quinn's Advantage was associated with higher clinical pregnancy rates than G5 (odds ratio (OR) 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 2.16; 692 women).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	This study was available only as an abstract and the quality of the evidence was low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	With regards to adverse effects, three studies reported multiple pregnancies and six studies reported miscarriage.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	None of them found any evidence of a difference between the culture media used.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	None of the studies reported on the health of offspring.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	Most studies (22/32) failed to report their source of funding and none described their methodology in adequate detail.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	The overall quality of the evidence was rated as very low for nearly all comparisons, the main limitations being imprecision and poor reporting of study methods.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	An optimal embryo culture medium is important for embryonic development and subsequently the success of IVF or ICSI treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	There has been much controversy about the most appropriate embryo culture medium.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	Numerous studies have been performed, but no two studies compared the same culture media and none of them found any evidence of a difference between the culture media used.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific culture medium.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007876.pub2	Properly designed and executed randomised trials are necessary.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006011.pub2	The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006011.pub2	A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006011.pub2	Articles reporting the same primary data accounted for 6 of the publications	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006011.pub2	Brown 1997; Brown 1998; Brown 1999; Brown 2000; Hack 2000; Hack 2003 which left 23 original papers to be reviewed for inclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006011.pub2	Of these, none met the inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006011.pub2	Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006011.pub2	The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006011.pub2	The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006011.pub2	The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006011.pub2	As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	We included two new papers, one of which was an update of a previously included study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	Therefore, a total of 17 RCTs with 1006 randomised participants met the inclusion criteria, with the one new study contributing an additional 113 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	There was a significant reduction in reports of chest pain in the first three months following the intervention: random-effects relative risk = 0.70 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	This was maintained from three to nine months afterwards: relative risk 0.59 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.76).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	There was also a significant increase in the number of chest pain-free days up to three months following the intervention: mean difference (MD) 3.00 (95% CI 0.23 to 5.77).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	This was associated with reduced chest pain frequency (random-effects MD -2.26, 95% CI -4.41 to -0.12) but there was no evidence of effect of treatment on chest pain frequency from three to twelve months (random-effects MD -0.81, 95% CI -2.35 to 0.74).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	There was no effect on severity (random-effects MD -4.64 (95% CI -12.18 to 2.89) up to three months after the intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	Due to the nature of the main interventions of interest, it was impossible to blind the therapists as to whether the participant was in the intervention or control arm.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	In addition, in three studies the blinding of participants was expressly forbidden by the local ethics committee because of issues in obtaining fully informed consent .	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	For this reason, all studies had a high risk of performance bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	In addition, three studies were thought to have a high risk of outcome bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	In general, there was a low risk of bias in the other domains.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	However, there was high heterogeneity and caution is required in interpreting these results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	The wide variability in secondary outcome measures made it difficult to integrate findings from studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	This Cochrane review suggests a modest to moderate benefit for psychological interventions, particularly those using a cognitive-behavioural framework, which was largely restricted to the first three months after the intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	Hypnotherapy is also a possible alternative.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	However, these conclusions are limited by high heterogeneity in many of the results and low numbers of participants in individual studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	The evidence for other brief interventions was less clear.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004101.pub5	Further RCTs of psychological interventions for NSCP with follow-up periods of at least 12 months are needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	We identified 30 trials with a total of 4344 participants randomised, with 17 different drugs or treatment comparisons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	The following antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers were evaluated in at least one RCT: nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate, olopatadine, ketotifen, azelastine, emedastine, levocabastine (or levocabastine), mequitazine, bepotastine besilate, combination of antazoline and tetryzoline, combination of levocabastine and pemirolast potassium.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	We observed a large variability in reporting outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	The quality of the studies and reporting was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	Trials evaluated only short-term effects, with a range of treatment of one to eight weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	Meta-analysis was only possible in one comparison (olopatadine versus ketotifen).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	There was some evidence to support that topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	There were no reported serious adverse events related to the use of topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	It seems that all reported topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo in the short term.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	However, there is no long-term data on their efficacy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	Direct comparisons of different antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers need to be interpreted with caution.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	Overall, topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers appear to be safe and well tolerated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	We observed a large variability in outcomes reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2	Poor quality of reporting challenged the synthesis of evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	Two studies met all of the eligibility criteria for inclusion within the review and a third was identified as ongoing.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	The two included studies employed multi-component community-based interventions tailored to the specific cultural aspects of the population and were based in Native American populations (1505 subjects in total).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	No difference was observed in weekly smoking at 42 months follow-up in the one study assessing this outcome (skills-community group versus control: risk ratio [RR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; skills-only group versus control: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	For smokeless tobacco use, no difference was found between the skills-community arm and the control group at 42 weeks (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30), though a significant difference was observed between the skills-only arm and the control group (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.85).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	Whilst the second study found positive changes for tobacco use in the intervention arm at post test (p < 0.05), this was not maintained at six month follow-up (change score -0.11 for intervention and 0.07 for control).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	Both studies were rated as high or unclear risk of bias in seven or more domains (out of a total of 10).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	Based on the available evidence, a conclusion cannot be drawn as to the efficacy of tobacco prevention initiatives tailored for Indigenous youth.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	This review highlights the paucity of data and the need for more research in this area.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	Smoking prevalence in Indigenous youth is twice that of the non-Indigenous population, with tobacco experimentation commencing at an early age.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	As such, a significant health disparity exists where Indigenous populations, a minority, are over-represented in the burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2	Methodologically rigorous trials are needed to investigate interventions aimed at preventing the uptake of tobacco use amongst Indigenous youth and to assist in bridging the gap between tobacco-related health disparities in Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010378.pub3	Out of six relevant reports identified by the search strategy, one trial involving 72 women with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) met our inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010378.pub3	The trial was at unclear risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010378.pub3	Overall, there were few events for most of the reported outcomes and the results were generally imprecise.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010378.pub3	The included trial reported no maternal mortality occurring in women who received either prophylactic or selective blood transfusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010378.pub3	Very low-quality evidence indicated no clear differences in maternal mortality, perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 13.22; very low-quality evidence) or markers of severe maternal morbidity (pulmonary embolism (no events); congestive cardiac failure (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.38; very low-quality evidence); acute chest syndrome (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.75)) between the treatment groups (prophylactic blood transfusion versus selective blood transfusion).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010378.pub3	Low-quality evidence indicated that prophylactic blood transfusion reduced the risk of pain crisis compared with selective blood transfusion (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.67, one trial, 72 women; low-quality evidence), and no differences in the occurrence of acute splenic sequestration (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.92; low-quality evidence), haemolytic crises (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.06) or delayed blood transfusion reaction (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.54 to 7.39; very low-quality evidence) between the comparison groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010378.pub3	Other relevant maternal outcomes pre-specified for this review such as cumulative duration of hospital stay, postpartum haemorrhage and iron overload, and infant outcomes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and haemolytic disease of the newborn, were not reported by the trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010378.pub3	Evidence from one small trial of very low quality suggests that prophylactic blood transfusion to pregnant women with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) confers no clear clinical benefits when compared with selective transfusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010378.pub3	Currently, there is no evidence from randomised or quasi-randomised trials to provide reliable advice on the optimal blood transfusion policy for women with other variants of sickle cell disease (i.e. HbSC and HbSβThal).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010378.pub3	The available data and quality of evidence on this subject are insufficient to advocate for a change in existing clinical practice and policy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	We identified 67 randomised clinical trials involving a total of 6197 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	All the trials were at high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	A total of 5771 participants from 64 trials provided data for one or more outcomes included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	There was no evidence of differences in most of the comparisons, and where there was, these differences were in single trials, mostly of small sample size.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	We summarise only the evidence that was available in more than one trial below.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	Of the primary outcomes, the only one with evidence of a difference from more than one trial under the pair-wise comparison was in the number of adverse events (complications), which was higher with radiofrequency dissecting sealer than with the clamp-crush method (rate ratio 1.85, 95% CrI 1.07 to 3.26; 250 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	Among the secondary outcomes, the only differences we found from more than one trial under the pair-wise comparison were the following: blood transfusion (proportion) was higher in the low central venous pressure group than in the acute normovolemic haemodilution plus low central venous pressure group (OR 3.19, 95% CrI 1.56 to 6.95; 208 participants; 2 studies; low-quality evidence); blood transfusion quantity (red blood cells) was lower in the fibrin sealant group than in the control (MD −0.53 units, 95% CrI −1.00 to −0.07; 122 participants; 2; very low-quality evidence); blood transfusion quantity (fresh frozen plasma) was higher in the oxidised cellulose group than in the fibrin sealant group (MD 0.53 units, 95% CrI 0.36 to 0.71; 80 participants; 2 studies; very low-quality evidence); blood loss (MD −0.34 L, 95% CrI −0.46 to −0.22; 237 participants; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence), total hospital stay (MD −2.42 days, 95% CrI −3.91 to −0.94; 197 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence), and operating time (MD −15.32 minutes, 95% CrI −29.03 to −1.69; 192 participants; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence) were lower with low central venous pressure than with control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	For the other comparisons, the evidence for difference was either based on single small trials or there was no evidence of differences.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or time needed to return to work.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	Paucity of data meant that we could not assess transitivity assumptions and inconsistency for most analyses.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	When direct and indirect comparisons were available, network meta-analysis provided additional effect estimates for comparisons where there were no direct comparisons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	However, the paucity of data decreases the confidence in the results of the network meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	Low-quality evidence suggests that liver resection using a radiofrequency dissecting sealer may be associated with more adverse events than with the clamp-crush method.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	Low-quality evidence also suggests that the proportion of people requiring a blood transfusion is higher with low central venous pressure than with acute normovolemic haemodilution plus low central venous pressure; very low-quality evidence suggests that blood transfusion quantity (red blood cells) was lower with fibrin sealant than control; blood transfusion quantity (fresh frozen plasma) was higher with oxidised cellulose than with fibrin sealant; and blood loss, total hospital stay, and operating time were lower with low central venous pressure than with control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	There is no evidence to suggest that using special equipment for liver resection is of any benefit in decreasing the mortality, morbidity, or blood transfusion requirements (very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	Radiofrequency dissecting sealer should not be used outside the clinical trial setting since there is low-quality evidence for increased harm without any evidence of benefits.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010683.pub3	In addition, it should be noted that the sample size was small and the credible intervals were wide, and we cannot rule out considerable benefit or harm with a specific method of liver resection.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001433.pub2	Twenty-three trials involving 724 people were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001433.pub2	There is evidence supporting the use of systemic retinoids (improvement rate difference 44%, 95 CI 28 to 59%), oral PUVA (improvement rate difference 44%, 95 CI 26 to 62%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001433.pub2	However, a combination of PUVA and retinoids is better than the individual treatments.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001433.pub2	The use of topical steroid under hydrocolloid occlusion is beneficial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001433.pub2	It would also appear that low dose ciclosporin, tetracycline antibiotics and Grenz Ray Therapy may be useful in treating PPP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001433.pub2	Colchicine has a lot of side effects and it is unclear if it is effective and neither was topical PUVA (rate difference of 0.00, 95% CI -0.04 to +0.04).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001433.pub2	There is no evidence to suggest that short-term treatment with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) is effective.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001433.pub2	Many different interventions were reported to produce "improvement" in PPP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001433.pub2	There is, however, no standardised method for assessing response to treatment, and reductions in pustule counts or other empirical semi-quantitative scoring systems may be of little relevance to the patient.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001433.pub2	This review has shown that the ideal treatment for PPP remains elusive and that the standards of study design and reporting need to be improved to inform patients and those treating them of the relative merits of the many treatments available to them.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003825.pub4	Nine trials evaluated the dose-related blood pressure-lowering efficacy of five drugs within the loop diuretics class (furosemide 40 mg to 60 mg, cicletanine 100 mg to 150 mg, piretanide 3 mg to 6 mg, indacrinone enantiomer -2.5 mg to -10.0/+80 mg, and etozolin 200 mg) in 460 people with baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg for a mean duration of 8.8 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003825.pub4	The best estimate of systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy of loop diuretics was -7.9 (-10.4 to -5.4) mmHg/ -4.4 (-5.9 to -2.8) mmHg.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003825.pub4	Withdrawals due to adverse effects and serum biochemical changes did not show a significant difference.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003825.pub4	We performed additional searches in 2012 and 2014, which found no additional trials meeting the minimum inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003825.pub4	Based on the limited number of published RCTs, the systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering effect of loop diuretics is -8/-4 mmHg, which is likely an overestimate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003825.pub4	We graded the quality of evidence for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimates as "low" due to the high risk of bias of included studies and the high likelihood of publication bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003825.pub4	We found no clinically meaningful blood pressure-lowering differences between different drugs within the loop diuretic class.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003825.pub4	The dose-ranging effects of loop diuretics could not be evaluated.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003825.pub4	The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with loop diuretics because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	We included 58 trials, of which 48 trials with 2849 participants randomised to intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation (1558 participants) versus control (1291 participants) contributed data to one or more of the outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	All the trials except one trial with 30 participants were at high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	Various intraperitoneal local anaesthetic agents were used but bupivacaine in the liquid form was the most common local anaesthetic used.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	There were considerable differences in the methods of local anaesthetic instillation including the location (subdiaphragmatic, gallbladder bed, or both locations) and timing (before or after the removal of gallbladder) between the trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	There was no mortality in either group in the eight trials that reported mortality (0/236 (0%) in local anaesthetic instillation versus 0/210 (0%) in control group; very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	One participant experienced the outcome of serious morbidity (eight trials; 446 participants; 1/236 (0.4%) in local anaesthetic instillation group versus 0/210 (0%) in the control group; RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.13 to 67.06; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	Although the remaining trials did not report the overall morbidity, three trials (190 participants) reported that there were no intra-operative complications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	Twenty trials reported that there were no serious adverse events in any of the 715 participants who received local anaesthetic instillation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	None of the trials reported participant quality of life, return to normal activity, or return to work.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	The effect of local anaesthetic instillation on the proportion of participants discharged as day surgery between the two groups was imprecise and compatible with benefit and no difference of intervention (three trials; 242 participants; 89/160 (adjusted proportion 61.0%) in local anaesthetic instillation group versus 40/82 (48.8%) in control group; RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.58; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	The MD in length of hospital stay was 0.04 days (95% CI -0.23 to 0.32; five trials; 335 participants; low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	The pain scores as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) were significantly lower in the local anaesthetic instillation group than the control group at four to eight hours (32 trials; 2020 participants; MD -0.99 cm; 95% CI -1.10 to -0.88 on a VAS scale of 0 to 10 cm; very low quality evidence) and at nine to 24 hours (29 trials; 1787 participants; MD -0.53 cm; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.44; very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	Various subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to investigate the influence of the different local anaesthetic agents, different methods of local anaesthetic instillation, and different controls on the effectiveness of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation were inconsistent.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	Serious adverse events were rare in studies evaluating local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation (very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	There is very low quality evidence that it reduces pain in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	However, the clinical importance of this reduction in pain is unknown and likely to be small.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	Further randomised clinical trials of low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007337.pub3	Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their assessment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	We identified 74 unique studies as eligible for this review and categorized them according to the antigens they detected.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	Types 1 to 3 include HRP-2 (fromP. falciparum) either by itself or with other antigens.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	Types 4 and 5 included pLDH (from P. falciparum) either by itself or with other antigens.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	In comparisons with microscopy, we identified 71 evaluations of Type 1 tests, eight evaluations of Type 2 tests and five evaluations of Type 3 tests.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	In meta-analyses, average sensitivities and specificities (95% CI) were 94.8% (93.1% to 96.1%) and 95.2% (93.2% to 96.7%) for Type 1 tests, 96.0% (94.0% to 97.3%) and 95.3% (87.3% to 98.3%) for Type 2 tests, and 99.5% (71.0% to 100.0%) and 90.6% (80.5% to 95.7%) for Type 3 tests, respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	Overall for HRP-2, the meta-analytical average sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were 95.0% (93.5% to 96.2%) and 95.2% (93.4% to 99.4%), respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	For pLDH antibody-based RDTs verified with microscopy, we identified 17 evaluations of Type 4 RDTs and three evaluations of Type 5 RDTs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	In meta-analyses, average sensitivity for Type 4 tests was 91.5% (84.7% to 95.3%) and average specificity was 98.7% (96.9% to 99.5%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	For Type 5 tests, average sensitivity was 98.4% (95.1% to 99.5%) and average specificity was 97.5% (93.5% to 99.1%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	Overall for pLDH, the meta-analytical average sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were 93.2% (88.0% to 96.2%) and 98.5% (96.7% to 99.4%), respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	For both categories of test, there was substantial heterogeneity in study results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	Quality of the microscopy reference standard could only be assessed in 40% of studies due to inadequate reporting, but results did not seem to be influenced by the reporting quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	Overall, HRP-2 antibody-based tests (such as the Type 1 tests) tended to be more sensitive and were significantly less specific than pLDH-based tests (such as the Type 4 tests).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	If the point estimates for Type 1 and Type 4 tests are applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients where 30% of those presenting with symptoms have P. falciparum, Type 1 tests will miss 16 cases, and Type 4 tests will miss 26 cases.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	The number of people wrongly diagnosed with P. falciparum would be 34 with Type 1 tests, and nine with Type 4 tests.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	The sensitivity and specificity of all RDTs is such that they can replace or extend the access of diagnostic services for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	HRP-2 antibody types may be more sensitive but are less specific than pLDH antibody-based tests, but the differences are small.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008122.pub2	The HRP-2 antigen persists even after effective treatment and so is not useful for detecting treatment failures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003540.pub3	Five studies met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003540.pub3	All were conducted in the UK, and tested short-term changes in the consultation time allocated to each patient.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003540.pub3	Overall, our confidence in the results was very low; most studies had a high risk of bias, particularly due to non-random allocation of participants and the absence of data on participants' characteristics and small sample sizes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003540.pub3	We are uncertain whether altering appointment length increases primary care consultation length, number of referrals and investigations, prescriptions, or patient satisfaction based on very low-certainty evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003540.pub3	None of the studies reported on the effects of altering the length of consultation on resources used.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003540.pub3	We did not find sufficient evidence to support or refute a policy of altering the lengths of primary care physicians' consultations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003540.pub3	It is possible that these findings may change if high-quality trials are reported in the future.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003540.pub3	Further trials are needed that focus on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	The search identified 3952 abstracts which were scanned for relevance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	Three trials met the inclusion criteria (Milinkovic 2007; McComsey 2008; Sanchez-Conde 2005).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	All three trials were conducted in developed countries, participants were ART experienced and all had sustained virologic suppression at baseline.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	A total of 157 participants were recruited to the trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	Sample sizes ranged from 24 to 92 and more than 79% of participants were male.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	The studies were at a high risk of selection, performance/detection and selective outcome reporting biases.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	Some baseline characteristics differed among the groups, including triglyceride levels in two studies and body mass index in one study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	In light of variation in the design and follow-up of the study results, no meta-analysis was performed and the results of single studies are presented.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	There was no significant difference in virologic suppression in the included studies (Milinkovic 2007; McComsey 2008; Sanchez-Conde 2005); Risk Ratio (RR) 1.09 (95% CI: 0.93 to 1.28), 0.94 (95% CI:0.59 to 1.50) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.18) respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	Symptomatic hyperlactatemia was seen in the high dose arm of the Milinkovic 2007 study; RR 0.21 (95% CI: 0.01 to 4.66), in no participants in the McComsey 2008 trial and not reported on in the Sanchez-Conde 2005 trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	McComsey 2008 and Milinkovic 2007 demonstrated a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), reduction in limb fat and an increase in triglycerides in the high dose arms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	The studies did not indicate that any participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	This systematic review identified only three small trials that evaluated virologic efficacy and safety of high dose versus low dose stavudine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	All three trials were conducted in developed countries and none reported from developing countries yet stavudine remains a component of ART combination therapy in many developing countries.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	It was not possible to perform a meta-analysis on these trails.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	Individual results from the trials were imprecise and have not identified a clear advantage in virologic efficacy or safety between low and high dose stavudine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	Furthermore, enrolled participants were treatment experienced with sustained virologic suppression and so existing data cannot be generalized to settings where stavudine is currently used in ART naive patients with high viral loads.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007497.pub2	Stavudine dose reduction trials in ART naive patients, in developing countries where stavudine is still being used are warranted as the phasing out of stavudine that is recommended by WHO may not be immediately universally feasible.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3	Ten trials met the inclusion criteria for this review (n = 1658 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3	We found five trials to be at low risk of bias and five to be at moderate risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3	Six of the trials included recruitment manoeuvres as part of an open lung ventilation strategy that was different from control ventilation in aspects other than the recruitment manoeuvre (such as mode of ventilation, higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration and lower tidal volume or plateau pressure).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3	Six studies reported mortality outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3	Pooled data from five trials (1370 participants) showed a reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.97, P = 0.02, low-quality evidence), pooled data from five trials (1450 participants) showed no difference in 28-day mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.01, P = 0.06, low-quality evidence) and pooled data from four trials (1313 participants) showed no difference in in-hospital mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01, P = 0.07, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3	Data revealed no differences in risk of barotrauma (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.53, P = 0.60, seven studies, 1508 participants, moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3	We identified significant clinical heterogeneity in the 10 included trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3	Results are based upon the findings of several (five) trials that included an "open lung ventilation strategy", whereby the intervention group differed from the control group in aspects other than the recruitment manoeuvre (including co-interventions such as higher PEEP, different modes of ventilation and higher plateau pressure), making interpretation of the results difficult.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3	A ventilation strategy that included recruitment manoeuvres in participants with ARDS reduced intensive care unit mortality without increasing the risk of barotrauma but had no effect on 28-day and hospital mortality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3	We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low, as most of the included trials provided co-interventions as part of an open lung ventilation strategy, and this might have influenced results of the outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	Fifteen studies, involving 687 participants, were included in the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	Study quality was poor and sample sizes were frequently small.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	However, some pooled effects were analysed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	Three studies measured our primary outcome but individually did not report significant differences between treatment and control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	The use of 'as needed' medications was reduced in two studies, (47 patients), by relaxation therapy (OR 4.47, CI 1.22 to 16.44).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	There was no significant difference in FEV1 for relaxation therapy in four studies of 150 patients, (SMD -0.01, CI -0.41 to 0.40).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	Quality of life, measured using the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire in two studies, (48 patients), showed a positive effect following CBT (WMD 0.71, CI 0.23 to 1.19).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	Peak Expiratory Flow outcome data in two studies, (51 patients), indicated a significant difference in favour of bio-feedback therapy (SMD 0.66, CI 0.09 to 1.23) but no significant difference following relaxation therapy (WMD 43 L/min, CI -5 to 92 L/min).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	There was no statistically significant improvement in depression levels following relaxation therapy (SMD 0.17, CI -0.25 to 0.59).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	The remainder of the findings between studies were conflicting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	This may have been due to the different types of interventions used and the deficiencies in trial design.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	This review was unable to draw firm conclusions for the role of psychological interventions in asthma due to the absence of an adequate evidence base.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002982.pub3	Larger, well-conducted and reported randomised trials are required in this area, in order to determine the effects of these techniques in the treatment of asthma in adults.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	Thirty-five studies, including 6785 participants overall (of which 5365 in the arms of interest (antidepressant and benzodiazepines as monotherapy)) were included in this review; however, since studies addressed many different comparisons, only a few trials provided data for primary outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	We found low-quality evidence suggesting no difference between antidepressants and benzodiazepines in terms of response rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.47; participants = 215; studies = 2).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit for benzodiazepines compared to antidepressants in terms of dropouts due to any cause, even if confidence interval (CI) ranges from almost no difference to benefit with benzodiazepines (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.63; participants = 1449; studies = 7).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	We found some evidence suggesting that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are better tolerated than TCAs (when looking at the number of patients experiencing adverse effects).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	We failed to find clinically significant differences between individual benzodiazepines.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	The majority of studies did not report details on random sequence generation and allocation concealment; similarly, no details were provided about strategies to ensure blinding.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	The study protocol was not available for almost all studies so it is difficult to make a judgment on the possibility of outcome reporting bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	Information on adverse effects was very limited.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	The identified studies are not sufficient to comprehensively address the objectives of the present review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	The majority of studies enrolled a small number of participants and did not provide data for all the outcomes specified in the protocol.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	For these reasons most of the analyses were underpowered and this limits the overall completeness of evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	In general, based on the results of the current review, the possible role of antidepressants and benzodiazepines should be assessed by the clinician on an individual basis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	The choice of which antidepressant and/or benzodiazepine is prescribed can not be made on the basis of this review only, and should be based on evidence of antidepressants and benzodiazepines efficacy and tolerability, including data from placebo-controlled studies, as a whole.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	Data on long-term tolerability issues associated with antidepressants and benzodiazepines exposure should also be carefully considered.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	The present review highlights the need for further higher-quality studies comparing antidepressants with benzodiazepines, which should be conducted with high-methodological standards and including pragmatic outcome measures to provide clinicians with useful and practical data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2	Data from the present review will be included in a network meta-analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder, which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	Twenty-nine trials, that enrolled over 1,700 participants with pancreatic carcinoma, were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	Three eligible studies compared plastic stents to surgery.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	Endoscopic stenting with plastic stents was associated with a reduced risk of complications (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.81), but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33 - 64.86) when compared with surgery.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	There was a trend towards lower risk of 30-day mortality with plastic stents (p=0.07, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32, 1.04).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	One published study compared metal stents to surgery and reported lower costs and better quality-of-life with metal stents.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	Nine studies compared metal to plastic stents.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	Metal stents were associated with a lower risk of recurrent biliary obstruction than plastic stents (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 - 0.62).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	There was no significant difference in risk of technical failure, therapeutic failure, complications or 30-day mortality by meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	When different types of plastic stents were compared to polyethylene stents, only perflouro alkoxy plastic stents had superior outcomes in one trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	The addition of an anti-reflux valve improved the patency of Teflon stents.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	Endoscopic metal stents are the intervention of choice at present in patients with malignant distal obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic carcinoma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	In patients with short predicted survival, their patency benefits over plastic stents may not be realised.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4	Further RCTs are needed to determine the optimal stent type for these patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	We included five RCTs reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	Four RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	Risk of bias varied across studies, with some studies lacking details of allocation concealment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	It was not possible to blind practitioners in all of the included studies; this adds a performance bias that is inherent to the type of intervention studied in our review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	Only two studies reported the rate of complications.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	Meta-analysis showed that ultrasound guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt (risk ratio (RR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.85, 404 catheters, four RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) and fewer complications, such as haematoma formation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60, 222 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound guidance for the first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children than in older children.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	Similarly, our results suggest, but do not confirm, the possibility of a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound on the first attempt success rate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	We also found improved success rates within two attempts (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.51, 134 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) with ultrasound guidance compared with other types of guidance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	No studies reported data about ischaemic damage.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	We rated the quality of evidence for all outcomes as moderate owing to imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, modest sample sizes and limited numbers of events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	We identified moderate-quality evidence suggesting that ultrasound guidance for radial artery cannulation improves first and second attempt success rates and decreases the rate of complications as compared with palpation or Doppler auditory assistance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2	The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	We included one small RCT (80 male student participants conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2009) and three ITS studies (general population studies in Canadian provinces conducted in the 1970s and 80s).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	The RCT found that young men exposed to movies with a low-alcohol content drank less than men exposed to movies with a high-alcohol content (mean difference (MD) -0.65 drinks; 95% CI -1.2, -0.07; p value = 0.03, very-low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	Young men exposed to commercials with a neutral content compared with those exposed to commercials for alcohol drank less (MD -0.73 drinks; 95% CI -1.30, -0.16; p value = 0.01, very-low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	Outcomes were assessed immediately after the end of the intervention (lasting 1.5 hours), so no follow-up data were available.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low due to a serious risk of bias, serious indirectness of the included population and serious level of imprecision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	Two of the ITS studies evaluated the implementation of an advertising ban and one study evaluated the lifting of such a ban.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	Each of the three ITS studies evaluated a different type of ban (partial or full) compared with different degrees of restrictions or no restrictions during the control period.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	The results from the three ITS studies were inconsistent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	A meta-analysis of the two studies that evaluated the implementation of a ban showed an overall mean non-significant increase in beer consumption in the general population of 1.10% following the ban (95% CI -5.26, 7.47; p value = 0.43; I2 = 83%, very-low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	This finding is consistent with an increase, no difference, or a decrease in alcohol consumption.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	In the study evaluating the lifting of a total ban on all forms of alcohol advertising to a partial ban on spirits advertising only, which utilised an Abrupt Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average model, the volume of all forms of alcohol sales decreased by 11.11 kilolitres (95% CI -27.56, 5.34; p value = 0.19) per month after the ban was lifted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	In this model, beer and wine sales increased per month by 14.89 kilolitres (95% CI 0.39, 29.39; p value = 0.04) and 1.15 kilolitres (95% CI -0.91, 3.21; p value = 0.27), respectively, and spirits sales decreased statistically significantly by 22.49 kilolitres (95% CI -36.83, -8.15; p value = 0.002).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	Using the GRADE approach, the evidence from the ITS studies was rated as very low due to a high risk of bias arising from a lack of randomisation and imprecision in the results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	No other prespecified outcomes (including economic loss or hardship due to decreased alcohol sales) were addressed in the included studies and no adverse effects were reported in any of the studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	None of the studies were funded by the alcohol or advertising industries.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	There is a lack of robust evidence for or against recommending the implementation of alcohol advertising restrictions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010704.pub2	Advertising restrictions should be implemented within a high-quality, well-monitored research programme to ensure the evaluation over time of all relevant outcomes in order to build the evidence base.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	Eight randomized trials studying a total of 182 infants were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	There was no evidence of difference in short-term growth parameters when high and low MCT formulas were compared.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	The meta-analysis of weight gain based on five studies yielded a WMD of -0.35 g/kg/d (95% CI -1.44, 0.74).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	Similarly, meta-analysis of weight gain in g/d based on two studies showed no evidence of difference (WMD 2.09 g/d, 95% CI -1.46, 5.64).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	Length gain, based on five studies, showed a non-significant WMD of 0.14 cm/wk (95% CI -0.04, 0.31).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	Head circumference gain, based on data from five studies, showed a non-significant WMD -0.03 cm/wk (95% CI -0.15, 0.08).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	Only one study reported a statistically non-significant skin fold thickness gain, with a mean difference -0.15 mm/wk (95% CI -0.41, 0.11).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	Subgroup analyses according to % MCT in the high MCT formula, by 10% intervals showed no evidence of effect of high MCT on short-term weight gain within any subgroup.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	There are conflicting data (two studies) as to formula tolerance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	There is no evidence of effect on incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), based on small numbers in two trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	No studies were located addressing long-term growth parameters or neurodevelopmental outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	There is no evidence of difference between MCT and LCT on short-term growth, gastrointestinal intolerance, or necrotizing enterocolitis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	Therefore, neither formula type could be concluded to improve short-term growth or have less adverse effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	Further studies are necessary because the results from the included eight studies are imprecise due to small numbers and do not address important long-term outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002777	Additional research should aim to clarify effects on formula tolerance and on long-term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and include larger study populations to better evaluate effect on NEC incidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	We included one small trial (with data from 34 participants) comparing transcervical amnioinfusion with no amnioinfusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	The trial was considered to be at a high risk of bias overall, due to small numbers, inconsistency in the reporting and lack of information on blinding.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	Meta-analysis was not possible.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	Transcervical amnioinfusion was with room temperature saline at 10 mL per minute for 60 minutes, then 3 mL per minute until delivery versus no amnioinfusion.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	All women received intrauterine pressure catheter, acetaminophen and antibiotics (ampicillin or, if receiving Group B beta streptococcal prophylaxis, penicillin and gentamycin).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	We did not identify any trials that used transabdominal amnioinfusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	Compared to no amnioinfusion, transcervical amnioinfusion had no clear effect on the incidence of postpartum endometritis (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 7.87; absolute risk 176/1000 (95% CI 34 to 96) versus 118/1000;low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	Nor was there a clear effect in the incidence of neonatal infection (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 68.84; absolute risk 0/1000 (95% CI 0 to 0) versus 0/1000; low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	The outcome of perinatal death or severe morbidity (such as neonatal encephalopathy, intraventricular haemorrhage, admission to intensive/high care) was not reported in the included trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	In terms of this review's secondary outcomes, the rate of caesarean section was the same in both groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.83; absolute risk 294/1000 (95% CI 103 to 832) versus 294/1000; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	There was no clear difference in the duration of maternal antibiotic treatment between the amnioinfusion and no amnioinfusion control group (mean difference (MD) 16 hours, 95% CI -1.75 to 33.75); nor in the duration of hospitalisation (MD 3.00 hours, 95% CI -15.49 to 21.49).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	The study did not report any information about how many babies had a low Apgar score at five minutes after birth.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	Women in the amnioinfusion group had a lower temperature at delivery compared to women in the control group (MD -0.38°C, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.02) but this outcome was not pre-specified in the protocol for this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	The majority of this review's secondary outcomes were not reported in the included study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to fully evaluate the effectiveness of using transcervical amnioinfusion for chorioamnionitis and to assess the safety of this intervention or women’s satisfaction.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	We did not identify any trials that used transabdominal amnioinfusion.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	The evidence in this review can neither support nor refute the use of transcervical amnioinfusion outside of clinical trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	We included one small study that reported on a limited number of outcomes of interest in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	The numbers included in this review are too small for meaningful assessment of substantive outcomes, where reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	For those outcomes we assessed using GRADE (postpartum endometritis, neonatal infection, and caesarean section), we downgraded the quality of the evidence to low - with downgrading decisions based on small numbers and a lack of information on blinding.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	The included study did not report on this review's other primary outcome (perinatal death or severe morbidity).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	The reduction in pyrexia, though not a pre-specified outcome of this review, may be of relevance in terms of benefits to the fetus of reduced exposure to heat.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	We postulate that the temperature reduction found may be a direct cooling effect of amnioinfusion with room temperature fluid, rather than reduction of infection.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	Larger trials are needed to confirm and extend the findings of the trial reviewed here.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	These should be randomised controlled trials; participants, women with chorioamnionitis; interventions, amnioinfusion; comparisons, no amnioinfusion; outcomes, maternal and perinatal outcomes including neurodevelopmental measures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	Further research is justified to determine possible benefits or risks of amnioinfusion for chorioamnionitis, and to investigate possible benefits of reducing temperature in fetuses considered at risk of neurological damage.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011622.pub2	Research should include randomised trials to examine transcervical or transabdominal amnioinfusion compared with no infusion for chorioamnionitis and examine outcomes listed in the methods of this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010860.pub2	Three studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1620 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010860.pub2	The sensitivities of the Mini-Cog in the individual studies were reported as 0.99, 0.76 and 0.99.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010860.pub2	The specificity of the Mini-Cog varied in the individual studies and was 0.93, 0.89 and 0.83.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010860.pub2	There was clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the studies which precluded a pooled meta-analysis of the results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010860.pub2	Methodological limitations were present in all the studies introducing potential sources of bias, specifically with respect to the methods for participant selection.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010860.pub2	There are currently few studies assessing the diagnostic test accuracy of the Mini-Cog in community settings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010860.pub2	The limited number of studies and the methodological limitations that are present in the current studies make it difficult to provide recommendations for or against the use of the Mini-Cog as a cognitive screening test in community settings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010860.pub2	Additional well-designed studies comparing the Mini-Cog to other brief cognitive screening tests are required in order to determine the accuracy and utility of the Mini-Cog in community based settings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	We included 19 studies that investigated three types of amphetamines: dexamphetamine (10.2 mg/d to 21.8 mg/d), lisdexamfetamine (30 mg/d to 70 mg/d), and mixed amphetamine salts (MAS; 12.5 mg/d to 80 mg/d).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	These studies enrolled 2521 participants; most were middle-aged (35.3 years), Caucasian males (57.2%), with a combined type of ADHD (78.8%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Eighteen studies were conducted in the USA, and one study was conducted in both Canada and the USA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Ten were multi-site studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	All studies were placebo-controlled, and three also included an active comparator: guanfacine, modafinil, or paroxetine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Most studies had short-term follow-up and a mean study length of 5.3 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	We found no studies that had low risk of bias in all domains of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias’ tool, mainly because amphetamines have powerful subjective effects that may reveal the assigned treatment, but also because we noted attrition bias, and because we could not rule out the possibility of a carry-over effect in studies that used a cross-over design.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Sixteen studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry, one study was publicly funded, and two studies did not report their funding sources.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Severity of ADHD symptoms: we found low- to very low-quality evidence suggesting that amphetamines reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians (SMD −0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.04 to −0.75; 13 studies, 2028 participants) and patients (SMD −0.51, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.28; six studies, 120 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Retention: overall, we found low-quality evidence suggesting that amphetamines did not improve retention in treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13; 17 studies, 2323 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Adverse events: we found that amphetamines were associated with an increased proportion of patients who withdrew because of adverse events (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.63 to 4.45; 17 studies, 2409 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Type of amphetamine: we found differences between amphetamines for the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Both lisdexamfetamine (SMD −1.06, 95% CI −1.26 to −0.85; seven studies, 896 participants; low-quality evidence) and MAS (SMD −0.80, 95% CI −0.93 to −0.66; five studies, 1083 participants; low-quality evidence) reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	In contrast, we found no evidence to suggest that dexamphetamine reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms (SMD −0.24, 95% CI −0.80 to 0.32; one study, 49 participants; very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	In addition, all amphetamines were efficacious in reducing the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by patients (dexamphetamine: SMD −0.77, 95% CI −1.14 to −0.40; two studies, 35 participants; low-quality evidence; lisdexamfetamine: SMD −0.33, 95% CI −0.65 to −0.01; three studies, 67 participants; low-quality evidence; MAS: SMD −0.45, 95% CI −1.02 to 0.12; one study, 18 participants; very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Dose at study completion: different doses of amphetamines did not appear to be associated with differences in efficacy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Type of drug-release formulation: we investigated immediate- and sustained-release formulations but found no differences between them for any outcome.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	We found no evidence that amphetamines improved ADHD symptom severity compared to other drug interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Amphetamines improved the severity of ADHD symptoms, as assessed by clinicians or patients, in the short term but did not improve retention to treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Amphetamines were associated with higher attrition due to adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	The short duration of studies coupled with their restrictive inclusion criteria limits the external validity of these findings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Furthermore, none of the included studies had an overall low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3	Overall, the evidence generated by this review is of low or very low quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007771.pub3	We included six new studies (517 participants) in this review update, bringing the total of included studies to 10 (811 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007771.pub3	The studies were heterogeneous with regard to study quality, the chronic painful conditions that were investigated, the dose of vitamin D given, co-interventions, and the outcome measures reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007771.pub3	Only two studies reported responder pain outcomes; the other studies reported treatment group average outcomes only.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007771.pub3	Overall, there was no consistent pattern that vitamin D treatment was associated with greater efficacy than placebo in any chronic painful condition (low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007771.pub3	Adverse events and withdrawals were comparatively infrequent, with no consistent difference between vitamin D and placebo (good quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007771.pub3	The evidence addressing the use of vitamin D for chronic pain now contains more than twice as many studies and participants than were included in the original version of this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007771.pub3	Based on this evidence, a large beneficial effect of vitamin D across different chronic painful conditions is unlikely.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007771.pub3	Whether vitamin D can have beneficial effects in specific chronic painful conditions needs further investigation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001481	Forty-one studies were included involving more than 200 practices and 48,000 patients.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD001481	The methodological quality of the studies was often poor.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001481	In all studies the intervention strategy was multifaceted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001481	In 12 studies the interventions were targeted at health professionals, in nine they were targeted at the organisation of care, and 20 studies targeted both.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001481	In 15 studies patient education was added to the professional and organisational interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001481	A combination of professional interventions improved process outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001481	The effect on patient outcomes remained less clear as these were rarely assessed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001481	Arrangements for follow-up (organisational intervention) also showed a favourable effect on process outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001481	Multiple interventions in which patient education was added or in which the role of the nurse was enhanced also reported favourable effects on patients' health outcomes.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	Five trials met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	The studies included a total of 1503 women, with a mean of 301 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	The trials compared the following contraceptives: combined oral contraceptive (COC) versus transdermal contraceptive patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or levonorgestrel intrauterine system 20 µg/day (LNG-IUS 20); LNG-IUS 12 µg/day (LNG-IUS 12) versus LNG-IUS 16 µg/day (LNG-IUS 16); and LNG-IUS 20 versus the copper T380A intrauterine device (IUD).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	In the trials comparing two different types of methods, the study arms did not differ significantly for contraceptive efficacy or continuation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	The sample sizes were small for two of those studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	The only significant outcome was that a COC group had a higher proportion of women who discontinued for 'other personal reasons' compared with the group assigned to the LNG-IUS 20 (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.85), which may have little clinic relevance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	The trial comparing LNG-IUS 12 versus LNG-IUS 16 showed similar efficacy over one and three years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	In three trials that examined different LNG-IUS, continuation was at least 75% at 6 to 36 months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	We considered the overall quality of evidence to be moderate to low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	Limitations were due to trial design or limited reporting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	Different doses in the LNG-IUS did not appear to influence efficacy over three years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	In another study, continuation of the LNG-IUS appeared at least as high as that for the COC.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub3	The current evidence was insufficient to compare efficacy and continuation rates for hormonal and intrauterine contraceptive methods in women aged 25 years and younger.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	Eighty-eight trials were included (13 new trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	There were 42 trials of immunotherapy for house mite allergy; 27 pollen allergy trials; 10 animal dander allergy trials; two Cladosporium mould allergy, two latex and six trials looking at multiple allergens.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	Concealment of allocation was assessed as clearly adequate in only 16 of these trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	Significant heterogeneity was present in a number of comparisons.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	Overall, there was a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and medication, and improvement in bronchial hyper-reactivity following immunotherapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	There was a significant improvement in asthma symptom scores (standardised mean difference -0.59, 95% confidence interval -0.83 to -0.35) and it would have been necessary to treat three patients (95% CI 3 to 5) with immunotherapy to avoid one deterioration in asthma symptoms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	Overall it would have been necessary to treat four patients (95% CI 3 to 6) with immunotherapy to avoid one requiring increased medication.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	Allergen immunotherapy significantly reduced allergen specific bronchial hyper-reactivity, with some reduction in non-specific bronchial hyper-reactivity as well.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	There was no consistent effect on lung function.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	If 16 patients were treated with immunotherapy, one would be expected to develop a local adverse reaction.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	If nine patients were treated with immunotherapy, one would be expected to develop a systemic reaction (of any severity).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	Immunotherapy reduces asthma symptoms and use of asthma medications and improves bronchial hyper-reactivity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	One trial found that the size of the benefit is possibly comparable to inhaled steroids.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2	The possibility of local or systemic adverse effects (such as anaphylaxis) must be considered.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	We did not find any new study which were eligible for inclusion in this update.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	The total number of studies remained unchanged, six trials involving 1297 patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	Five trials had a low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	One trial had an unclear risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	Mortality at day 28 was significantly reduced by lung-protective ventilation with a relative risk (RR) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.88); hospital mortality was reduced with a RR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	Overall mortality was not significantly different if a plateau pressure less than or equal to 31 cm H2O in the control group was used (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.45).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	There was insufficient evidence for morbidity and long-term outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	Clinical heterogeneity, such as different lengths of follow up and higher plateau pressure in control arms in two trials, makes the interpretation of the combined results difficult.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	Mortality was significantly reduced at day 28 and at the end of the hospital stay.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	The effects on long-term mortality are unknown, although the possibility of a clinically relevant benefit cannot be excluded.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003844.pub4	Ventilation with lower tidal volumes is becoming a routine strategy of treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury, stopping investigators from carrying out additional trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	We included 15 RCTs with 1833 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	We determined that none of the RCTs were of high methodological quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	For our primary outcomes, pooled results from two trials suggest that time to emergence from anaesthesia, that is, time needed to follow verbal commands, was longer with isoflurane than with propofol (mean difference (MD) -3.29 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.41 to -1.18, low-quality evidence), and time to emergence from anaesthesia was not different with sevoflurane compared with propofol (MD 0.28 minutes slower with sevoflurane, 95% CI -0.56 to 1.12, four studies, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	Pooled analyses for adverse events suggest lower risk of nausea and vomiting with propofol than with sevoflurane (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91, low-quality evidence) or isoflurane (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78) and greater risk of haemodynamic changes with propofol than with sevoflurane (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.17), but no differences in the risk of shivering or pain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	Pooled analyses for brain relaxation suggest lower risk of tense brain with propofol than with isoflurane (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.17, low-quality evidence), but no difference when propofol is compared with sevoflurane.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	The finding of our review is that the intravenous technique is comparable with the inhalational technique of using sevoflurane to provide early emergence from anaesthesia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	Adverse events with both techniques are also comparable.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	However, we derived evidence of low quality from a limited number of studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	Use of isoflurane delays emergence from anaesthesia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	These results should be interpreted with caution.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	Randomized controlled trials based on uniform and standard methods are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2	Researchers should follow proper methods of randomization and blinding, and trials should be adequately powered.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD004034.pub3	The combined result of the four trials reporting incidence of dementia indicated no significant difference between treatment and placebo (236/7767 versus 259/7660, Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.89, 95% CI 0.74, 1.07) and there was considerable heterogeneity between the trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004034.pub3	The combined results from the three trials reporting change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) did not indicate a benefit from treatment (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) = 0.42, 95% CI 0.30, 0.53).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004034.pub3	Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were reduced significantly in the three trials assessing this outcome (WMD = -10.22, 95% CI -10.78, -9.66 for systolic blood pressure, WMD = -4.28, 95% CI -4.58, -3.98 for diastolic blood pressure).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004034.pub3	Three trials reported adverse effects requiring discontinuation of treatment and the combined results indicated no significant difference (OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.92, 1.11).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004034.pub3	When analysed separately, however, more patients on placebo in Syst Eur 1997 were likely to discontinue treatment due to side effects; the converse was true in SHEP 1991.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004034.pub3	Quality of life data could not be analysed in the four studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004034.pub3	Analysis of the included studies in this review was problematic as many of the control subjects received antihypertensive treatment because their blood pressures exceeded pre-set values.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004034.pub3	In most cases the study became a comparison between the study drug against a usual antihypertensive regimen.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD003334.pub2	The overall risk of bias was unclear for the majority of articles due to a lack of reported data; however, the authors determined that this would be unlikely to impact negatively as most data outcomes were objective (e.g. death vs. no death).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003334.pub2	There was no evidence of the effectiveness in improving patient outcomes of PTCRA in non-complex lesions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003334.pub2	In complex lesions, there were no statistically significant differences in re-stenosis rates at six months (RR 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.33) and at one year (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55) in those receiving PTCRA with adjunctive balloon angioplasty (PTCA) (PTCRA/PTCA) compared to those receiving PTCA alone.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD003334.pub2	The evidence for the effectiveness of PTCRA in in-stent re-stenosis is unclear Compared to angioplasty alone, PTCRA/PTCA did not result in a statistically significant increase in the risk of major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction (MI), emergency cardiac surgery or death) during the in-hospital period (RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.90).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003334.pub2	Compared to angioplasty, PTCRA was associated with nine times the risk of an angiographically detectable vascular spasm (RR 9.23; 95% CI 4.61 to 18.47), four times the risk of perforation (RR 4.28; 95% CI 0.92 to 19.83) and about twice the risk of transient vessel occlusions (RR 2.49; 95% CI 1.25 to 4.99) while angiographic dissections (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.68) and stents used as a bailout procedure (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.87) were less common.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD003334.pub2	Compared to angioplasty alone, PTCRA/PTCA did not result in a higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events, but patients were more likely to experience vascular spasm, perforation and transient vessel occlusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003334.pub2	In certain circumstances (e.g. patients ineligible for cardiac surgery, those with architecturally complex lesions, or those with lesions that fail PTCA), PTCRA may achieve satisfactory re-vascularisation in subsequent procedures.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	Three RCTs (333 participants) were identified, two of which were multicentre trials comprising only participants positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	The other trial enrolled participants clinically diagnosed with bronchiolitis from a hospital in Italy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	All studies used 2.5 mL (1 mg/mL) of nebulised rhDNase compared with placebo either as a daily or a twice daily dose.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	Adjunctive therapy included nebulised salbutamol, steroids, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids or tube feeding, nasal washing, nasal decongestants and antibiotics.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	Overall, nebulised rhDNase showed no benefit in clinically meaningful outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	Meta-analysis favoured the control group with a shorter duration of hospital stay (MD 0.50; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.90, P = 0.01) and better clinical score improvement (SMD -0.24; 95% CI -0.50 to 0.01, P = 0.06).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	The largest trial showed no difference in supplemental oxygen use or intensive care unit (ICU) admission.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	In one RCT, four out of 11 patients in the treatment group had atelectasis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	Two of these patients showed distinctive clinical improvement after nebulised rhDNase.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	There was no significant difference in adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	These included temporary desaturation, temporary coughing, increased coughing, facial rash, hoarseness, dyspnoea and bad taste, reported in a total of 11 patients from both treatment groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	The results based on the three included studies in this review did not support the use of nebulised rhDNase in children under 24 months of age hospitalised with acute bronchiolitis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	In these patients, treatment did not shorten the length of hospitalisation or improve clinical outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008395.pub2	It might have a role in severe bronchiolitis complicated by atelectasis, but further clinical studies would need to be performed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	Two studies with a total of 181 participants met the inclusion criteria, 116 undergoing the percutaneous technique and 65 treated by cut-down femoral artery access.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	One study had a small sample size and did not adequately report method of randomisation, allocation concealment or pre-selected outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	The second study was a larger study with few sources of bias and good methodology.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	We observed no significant difference in mortality between groups, with only one mortality occurring overall, in the totally percutaneous group (risk ratio (RR) 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 36.18; 181 participants; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	Only one study reported aneurysm exclusion.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	In this study we observed only one failure of aneurysm exclusion in the surgical cut-down femoral artery access group (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.02; 151 participants; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	No wound infections occurred in the cut-down femoral artery access group or the percutaneous group across either study (moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	There was no difference in major complication rate between cut-down femoral artery access and percutaneous groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.68; 181 participants; moderate-quality evidence); or in bleeding complications and haematoma (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.82; 181 participants; high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	Only one study reported long-term complication rates at six months, with no differences between the percutaneous and cut-down femoral artery access group (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.34 to 3.15; 134 participants; moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	We detected differences in surgery time, with percutaneous approach being significantly faster than cut-down femoral artery access (mean difference (MD) -31.46 minutes; 95% CI -47.51 minutes to -15.42 minutes; 181 participants; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	Only one study reported duration of ITU (intensive treatment unit) and hospital stay, with no difference found between groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	This review shows moderate-quality evidence of no difference between the percutaneous approach compared with cut-down femoral artery access group for short-term mortality, aneurysm exclusion, major complications, wound infection and long-term (six month) complications, and high-quality evidence for no difference in bleeding complications and haematoma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	There was a difference in operating time, with moderate-quality evidence showing that the percutaneous approach was faster than the cut-down femoral artery access technique.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate as a result of the limited number of studies, low event numbers and imprecision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	As the number of included studies were limited, further research into this technique would be beneficial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010185.pub3	The search identified one ongoing study, which may provide an improved evidence base in the future.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003172	Two trials met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003172	The sponge was significantly less effective in both trials in preventing overall pregnancy than was the diaphragm.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003172	In the larger USA trial, the 12-month cumulative life-table termination rates per 100 women for overall pregnancy were 17.4 for the sponge and 12.8 for the diaphragm.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003172	The rates were 24.5 for the sponge and 10.9 for the diaphragm in the UK trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003172	Similarly, discontinuation rates at 12 months were higher with the sponge than with the diaphragm (Odds ratio 1.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.59).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003172	Allergic-type reactions were more common with the sponge, although discontinuation for discomfort differed in the two trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003172	No new trials have been identified since the initial review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003172	The sponge was less effective than the diaphragm in preventing pregnancy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003172	Discontinuation rates were higher at 12 months as well.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003172	Other randomized controlled trials will be needed to resolve the potential role of spermicides in preventing sexually transmitted infections or in causing adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	Sixteen studies were identified for possible inclusion in the review, six of which were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	Three studies investigated prevention and three studies investigated amelioration.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	Due to differences between studies in the interventions being evaluated, a meta-analysis was not possible.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	Two studies investigated a pharmacological intervention for the prevention of cognitive deficits; memantine compared with placebo, and d-threo-methylphenidate HCL compared with placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	In the first study the primary cognitive outcome of memory at six months did not reach significance, but there was significant improvement in overall cognitive function compared to placebo, with similar adverse events across groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	The second study found no statistically significant difference between arms, with few adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	The third study investigated a rehabilitation program for the prevention of cognitive deficits but did not carry out a statistical comparison of cognitive performance between groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	Three studies investigated the use of a pharmacological intervention for the treatment of cognitive deficits; methylphenidate compared with modafinil, two different doses of modafinil, and donepezil compared with placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	The first study found improvements in cognitive function in both the methylphenidate and modafinil arms; few adverse events were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	The second study combined treatment arms and found improvements across all cognitive tests, however, a number of adverse events were reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	Both studies were limited by a small sample size.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	The third study did not find an improvement in the primary cognitive outcome of overall performance, but did find improvement in an individual test of memory, compared to placebo; adverse events were not reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	No non-pharmacological studies for the amelioration of cognitive deficits were eligible.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	There were a number of limitations across studies but few without high risks of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	There is supportive evidence that memantine may help prevent cognitive deficits for adults with brain metastases receiving cranial irradiation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	There is supportive evidence that donepezil may have a role in treating cognitive deficits in adults with primary or metastatic brain tumours who have been treated with cranial irradiation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	Patient withdrawal affected the statistical power of both studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	Further research that tries to minimise the withdrawal of consent, and subsequently reduce the requirement for imputation procedures, may offer a higher quality of evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	There is no strong evidence to support any non-pharmacological interventions (medical or cognitive/behavioural) in the prevention or amelioration of cognitive deficits.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	Non-randomised studies appear promising but are as yet to be conclusive via translation into high quality evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011335.pub2	Further research is required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	Two studies assessed as at high risk of bias, reporting data from 26 analysed participants were included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	The age range of participants was from 17 to 55 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	Both trials investigated the effectiveness of low-level laser treatment compared to placebo laser therapy on inferior alveolar sensory deficit as a result of iatrogenic injury.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	Patient-reported altered sensation was partially reported in one study and fully reported in another.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	Following treatment with laser therapy, there was some evidence of an improvement in the subjective assessment of neurosensory deficit in the lip and chin areas compared to placebo, though the estimates were imprecise: a difference in mean change in neurosensory deficit of the chin of 8.40 cm (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67 to 13.13) and a difference in mean change in neurosensory deficit of the lip of 21.79 cm (95% CI 5.29 to 38.29).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	The overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was very low; the outcome data were fully reported in one small study of 13 patients, with differential drop-out in the control group, and patients suffered only partial loss of sensation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	No studies reported on the effects of the intervention on the remaining primary outcomes of pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	No studies reported on quality of life or adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	The overall quality of the evidence was very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the studies, indirectness of the evidence and the imprecision of the results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	There is clearly a need for randomised controlled clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of surgical, medical and psychological interventions for iatrogenic inferior alveolar and lingual nerve injuries.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005293.pub2	Primary outcomes of this research should include: patient-focused morbidity measures including altered sensation and pain, pain, quantitative sensory testing and the effects of delayed treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	Two trials (281 pregnancies and 282 fetuses) met our inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	However, the two trials had significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity such that a meta-analysis combining trial data was considered inappropriate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	One trial (involving 161 pregnancies) was based on women with a history of diabetes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	It showed no statistically significant difference between using combined oestrogen and progestogen and using placebo for all our proposed primary outcomes, namely, miscarriage (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 2.80), perinatal death (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.69) and preterm birth (less than 34 weeks of gestation) (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.04).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	In terms of this review's secondary outcomes, use of combined oestrogen and progestogen was associated with an increased risk of maternal cancer in the reproductive system (RR 6.65, 95% CI 1.56 to 28.29).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	However, for the outcome of cancer other than that of the reproductive system in mothers, there was no difference between groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	Similarly, there were no differences between the combined oestrogen and progestogen group versus placebo for other secondary outcomes reported: low birthweight of less than 2500 g, genital abnormalities in the offspring, abnormalities other than genital tract in the offspring, cancer in the reproductive system in the offspring, or cancer other than of the reproductive system in the offspring.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	The second study was based on pregnant women who had undergone in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	This study showed no difference in the rate of miscarriage between the combined oestrogen and progesterone group and the no treatment group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.85).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	The study did not report on this review's other primary outcomes (perinatal death or rates of preterm birth), nor on any of our proposed secondary outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	There is an insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to assess the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone for preventing miscarriages.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009278.pub2	We strongly recommend further research in this area.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007954	There were fourteen studies (16 comparisons) with extractable data included in the review, of which ten studies examined TCAs, two examined SSRIs and two included both classes, all compared with placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007954	The number of participants in the intervention groups was 1364 and in the placebo groups 919.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007954	Nearly all studies were of short duration, typically 6-8 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007954	Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed an RR of 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.38 in favour of TCAs against placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007954	For SSRIs this was 1.28, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.43..	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007954	The numbers needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs ranged from 7 to 16 {median NNT 9} patient expected event rate ranged from 63% to 26% respectively) and for SSRIs from 7 to 8 {median NNT 7} (patient expected event rate ranged from 48% to 42% respectively) .	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007954	The numbers needed to harm (NNH for withdrawal due to side effects) ranged from 4 to 30 for TCAs (excluding three studies with no harmful events leading to withdrawal) and 20 to 90 for SSRIs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007954	Both TCAs and SSRIs are effective for depression treated in primary care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	No new studies were found for this update.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	Nine included studies (4373 participants, 5223 attacks) compared ibuprofen with placebo or other active comparators; none combined ibuprofen with a self-administered antiemetic.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	All studies treated attacks with single doses of medication.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	For ibuprofen 400 mg versus placebo, NNTs for 2-hour pain-free (26% versus 12% with placebo), 2-hour headache relief (57% versus 25%) and 24-hour sustained headache relief (45% versus 19%) were 7.2, 3.2 and 4.0, respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	For ibuprofen 200 mg versus placebo, NNTs for 2-hour pain-free (20% versus 10%) and 2-hour headache relief (52% versus 37%) were 9.7 and 6.3, respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	The higher dose was significantly better than the lower dose for 2-hour headache relief.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	Soluble formulations of ibuprofen 400 mg were better than standard tablets for 1-hour, but not 2-hour headache relief.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	Similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events, which were mostly mild and transient, with ibuprofen and placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	Ibuprofen 400 mg did not differ from rofecoxib 25 mg for 2-hour headache relief or 24-hour headache relief.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	We found no new studies since the last version of this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	Ibuprofen is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, providing pain relief in about half of sufferers, but complete relief from pain and associated symptoms for only a minority.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	NNTs for all efficacy outcomes were better with 400 mg than 200 mg in comparisons with placebo, and soluble formulations provided more rapid relief.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub3	Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, occurring at the same rate as with placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	We included 43 randomized controlled trials (3497 participants with dry eye).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	Due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics among the included trials with respect to types of diagnostic criteria, interventions, comparisons, and measurements taken, our ability to perform meta-analyses was limited.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	The review found that, in general, there was uncertainty whether different OTC artificial tears provide similar relief of signs and symptoms when compared with each other or placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	Nevertheless, we found that 0.2% polyacrylic acid-based artificial tears were consistently more effective at treating dry eye symptoms than 1.4% polyvinyl alcohol-based artificial tears in two trials assessing this comparison (175 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	All other included artificial tears produced contradictory between-group results or found no between-group differences.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	Our review also found that OTC artificial tears may be generally safe, but not without adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	Overall, we assessed the quality of evidence as low due to high risks of bias among included trials and poor reporting of outcome measures which were insufficient for quantitative analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	Furthermore, we identified an additional 18 potentially eligible trials that were reported only in clinical trial registers with no associated results or publications.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	These trials reportedly enrolled 2079 total participants for whom no data are available.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	Such lack of reporting of trial results represents a high risk of publication bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	OTC artificial tears may be safe and effective means for treating dry eye syndrome; the literature indicates that the majority of OTC artificial tears may have similar efficacies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	This conclusion could be greatly skewed by the inconsistencies in study designs and inconsistencies in reporting trial results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2	Additional research is therefore needed before we can draw robust conclusions about the effectiveness of individual OTC artificial tear formulations.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD006517.pub3	There was no difference in virological outcomes in the group who maintained lamivudine and those who did not in their subsequent regimens.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006517.pub3	Two other small observational studies reported in abstract form also did not report a difference in the proportion of those with viral suppression after six months and time to HIV-1 RNA suppression among those on a lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) regimen compared to those on a 3TC/FTC-sparing second-line regimen.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006517.pub3	There were no trials identified comparing boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) or nucleoside backbone combinations after first-line failure on non-thymidine analog combinations.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD006517.pub3	One randomised trial in 136 patients and two observational studies (both of low quality) suggest no difference in virological suppression whether or not lamivudine is maintained in a second-line regimen.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006517.pub3	While outcomes of second-line regimens with boosted PIs are favourable in general, there are no studies comparing boosted PIs directly in populations starting second-line regimens.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006517.pub3	Current recommendations are based on available resources and patient- and public-health-level considerations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	We included 133 (127 cohort type and 6 case-control) studies involving 844,206 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	We evaluated a total of seven different prespecified index tests in the 133 studies, as well as 69 non-prespecified, and 32 combinations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	For the prespecified index tests, we found six studies for the Mallampati test, 105 for the modified Mallampati test, six for the Wilson risk score, 52 for thyromental distance, 18 for sternomental distance, 34 for the mouth opening test, and 30 for the upper lip bite test.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	Difficult face mask ventilation was the reference standard in seven studies, difficult laryngoscopy in 92 studies, difficult tracheal intubation in 50 studies, and failed intubation in two studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	Across all studies, we judged the risk of bias to be variable for the different domains; we mostly observed low risk of bias for patient selection, flow and timing, and unclear risk of bias for reference standard and index test.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	Applicability concerns were generally low for all domains.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	For difficult laryngoscopy, the summary sensitivity ranged from 0.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.33; mouth opening test) to 0.67 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.83; upper lip bite test) and the summary specificity ranged from 0.80 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.85; modified Mallampati test) to 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.98; Wilson risk score).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	The upper lip bite test for diagnosing difficult laryngoscopy provided the highest sensitivity compared to the other tests (P < 0.001).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	For difficult tracheal intubation, summary sensitivity ranged from 0.24 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.43; thyromental distance) to 0.51 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.61; modified Mallampati test) and the summary specificity ranged from 0.87 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.91; modified Mallampati test) to 0.93 (0.87 to 0.96; mouth opening test).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	The modified Mallampati test had the highest sensitivity for diagnosing difficult tracheal intubation compared to the other tests (P < 0.001).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	For difficult face mask ventilation, we could only estimate summary sensitivity (0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.39) and specificity (0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95) for the modified Mallampati test.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	Bedside airway examination tests, for assessing the physical status of the airway in adults with no apparent anatomical airway abnormalities, are designed as screening tests.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	Screening tests are expected to have high sensitivities.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	We found that all investigated index tests had relatively low sensitivities with high variability.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	In contrast, specificities were consistently and markedly higher than sensitivities across all tests.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	The standard bedside airway examination tests should be interpreted with caution, as they do not appear to be good screening tests.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	Among the tests we examined, the upper lip bite test showed the most favourable diagnostic test accuracy properties.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	Given the paucity of available data, future research is needed to develop tests with high sensitivities to make them useful, and to consider their use for screening difficult face mask ventilation and failed intubation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2	The 27 studies in 'Studies awaiting classification' may alter the conclusions of the review, once we have assessed them.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3	Sixty-three studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 8014 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3	Of these, 56 trials recruited infants and young children.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3	The trials varied in the definition used for acute diarrhoea and the end of the diarrhoeal illness, as well as in the risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3	The trials were undertaken in a wide range of different settings and also varied greatly in organisms tested, dosage, and participants' characteristics.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3	No adverse events were attributed to the probiotic intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3	Probiotics reduced the duration of diarrhoea, although the size of the effect varied considerably between studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3	The average of the effect was significant for mean duration of diarrhoea (mean difference 24.76 hours; 95% confidence interval 15.9 to 33.6 hours; n=4555, trials=35) diarrhoea lasting ≥4 days (risk ratio 0.41; 0.32 to 0.53; n=2853, trials=29) and stool frequency on day 2 (mean difference 0.80; 0.45 to 1.14; n=2751, trials=20).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3	The differences in effect size between studies was not explained by study quality, probiotic strain, the number of different strains, the viability of the organisms, dosage of organisms, the causes of diarrhoea, or the severity of the diarrhoea, or whether the studies were done in developed or developing countries.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3	Used alongside rehydration therapy, probiotics appear to be safe and have clear beneficial effects in shortening the duration and reducing stool frequency in acute infectious diarrhoea.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub3	However, more research is needed to guide the use of particular probiotic regimens in specific patient groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2	We included only one study that compared nidotherapy-enhanced standard care with standard care alone (total 52 participants); this study was classified by its authors as a 'pilot study'.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2	The duration of the included study was 18 months in total.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2	The single study examined the short-term (up to six months) and medium-term (between six and 12 months) effects of nidotherapy-enhanced standard care versus standard care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2	Nidotherapy-enhanced standard care was favoured over standard care for social functioning in both the short term (n = 50, 1 RCT, MD -2.10, 95% CI -4.66 to 0.46) and medium term (n = 37, 1 RCT, MD -1.70, 95% CI -4.60 to 1.20, Very low quality); however, these results did not reach statistical significance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2	Results concerning engagement with non-inpatient services favoured the intervention group in both the short term (n = 50, 1 RCT, MD 2.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.87) and medium term (n = 37, 1 RCT, MD 1.70, 95% CI -0.09 to 3.49), with statistical significance evident in the short term, but not in the medium term.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2	Results of people leaving the study early favoured the intervention in the short term (n = 52, 1 RCT, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.98), with slight favour of the control group at medium term (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.54); again, these results did not reach statistical significance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2	Results for the adverse effects/events of death (measured by 12 months) favoured the intervention (n = 52, 1 RCT, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.74, Very low quality) but with no statistical significance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2	Skewed results were available for mental state, service use, and economic outcomes, and present a mixed picture of the benefits of nidotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2	Further research is needed into the possible benefits or harms of this newly-formulated therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2	Until such research is available, patients, clinicians, managers and policymakers should consider it an experimental approach.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Our searches identified two new published studies with classic design, and one new published study with an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal (EERW) design.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	We included eight studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Five (3283 participants) had a classic design in which participants were randomised at the start of the study to pregabalin (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily) or placebo, with assessment after 8 to 13 weeks of stable treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	No studies included active comparators.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Studies had low risk of bias, except that the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method used in analyses of the primary outcomes could overestimate treatment effect.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment (450 mg: RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.1, 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence)).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Substantial benefit with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 14% of participants with placebo, but about 9% more with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg (22% to 24%) (high quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing moderate benefit (at least 30% pain intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment) (450 mg: RR 1.5, 95% CI (1.3 to 1.7), 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Moderate benefit with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 28% of participants with placebo, but about 11% more with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg (39% to 43%) (high quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	A similar magnitude of effect was found using PGIC of 'very much improved' and 'much or very much improved'.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	NNTs for these outcomes ranged between 7 and 14 (high quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	A small study (177 participants) compared nightly with twice-daily pregabalin, and concluded there was no difference in effect.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Two studies (1492 participants began initial dose titration, 687 participants randomised) had an EERW design in which those with good pain relief after titration were randomised, double blind, to continuing the effective dose (300 to 600 mg pregabalin daily) or a short down-titration to placebo for 13 or 26 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	We calculated the outcome of maintained therapeutic response (MTR) without withdrawal, equivalent to a moderate benefit.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Of those randomised, 40% had MTR with pregabalin and 20% with placebo (high quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	The NNT was 5, but normalised to the starting population tested it was 12.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	About 10% of the initial population would have achieved the MTR outcome, similar to the result from studies of classic design.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	MTR had no imputation concerns.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	The majority (70% to 90%) of participants in all treatment groups experienced adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Specific adverse events were more common with pregabalin than placebo, in particular dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and peripheral oedema, with number needed to harm of 3.7, 7.4, 18, and 19 respectively for all doses combined (high quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Serious adverse events did not differ between active treatment groups and placebo (very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Withdrawals for any reason were more common with pregabalin than placebo only with the 600 mg dose in studies of classic design.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Withdrawals due to adverse events were about 10% higher with pregabalin than placebo, but withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were about 6% lower (high quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	Pregabalin 300 to 600 mg produces a major reduction in pain intensity over 12 to 26 weeks with tolerable adverse events for a small proportion of people (about 10% more than placebo) with moderate or severe pain due to fibromyalgia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	The degree of pain relief is known to be accompanied by improvements in other symptoms, quality of life, and function.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011790.pub2	These results are similar to other effective medicines in fibromyalgia (milnacipran, duloxetine).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	We included one trial (involving 135 women with mild pre-eclampsia at term).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	An additional six studies are awaiting further assessment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	The included trial compared magnesium sulphate with a placebo and was at a low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	The trial did not report any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	There was no significant difference between magnesium sulphate and placebo in Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (risk ratio (RR) 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 5.46; 135 infants), nor gestational age at birth (mean difference (MD) -0.20 weeks; 95% CI -0.62 to 0.22; 135 infants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	There were significantly more maternal side effects (feeling warm and flushed) in the magnesium sulphate group than in the placebo group (RR 3.81; 95% CI 2.22 to 6.53; 135 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	However, no significant difference in adverse effects severe enough to cease treatment was observed (RR 3.04; 95% CI 0.13 to 73.42; 135 women).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	There were no significant differences seen between groups in the rates of postpartum haemorrhage (RR 4.06; 95% CI 0.47 to 35.38; 135 women) and caesarean section (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.63; 135 women).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	There is currently insufficient evidence to assess the efficacy and safety of magnesium sulphate when administered to women for neuroprotection of the term fetus.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	As there has been recent evidence for the use of magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the preterm fetus, high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the safety profile and neurological outcomes for the term fetus.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009395.pub2	Strategies to reduce maternal side effects during treatment also require evaluation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009046.pub2	Four studies met all of the eligibility criteria for inclusion within the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009046.pub2	Two used combination therapies consisting of a pharmacotherapy combined with cognitive and behavioural therapies, whilst the remaining two used cognitive and behavioural therapy through counselling, one via text message support and the other delivered via clinic doctors trained in smoking cessation techniques.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009046.pub2	Smoking cessation data were pooled across all studies producing a statistically and clinically significant effect in favour of the intervention (risk ratio 1.43, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.98, p=0.032), however following sensitivity analysis a statistically non-significant but clinically significant effect was observed in favour of the intervention (risk ratio 1.33, 95%CI 0.95 to 1.85, p=NS) .	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009046.pub2	A significant health disparity exists, whereby Indigenous populations, a minority, are over-represented in the burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009046.pub2	This review highlights the paucity of evidence available to evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, despite the known success of these interventions in non-Indigenous populations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009046.pub2	Due to this lack of published investigations, the external validity of this review is limited, as is the ability to draw reliable conclusions from the results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009046.pub2	The limited but available evidence reported does indicate that smoking cessation interventions specifically targeted at Indigenous populations can produce smoking abstinence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009046.pub2	However this evidence base is not strong with a small number of methodologically sound trials investigating these interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009046.pub2	More rigorous trials are now required to assist in bridging the gap between tobacco related health disparities in Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	We included 13 studies (5686 patients).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	We judged blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment to be at high risk in about 50% of the included studies and at low risk in 25% to 30% of the studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	Regardless of the high risk of performance bias these studies were included based on the low weight the studies had in the meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	We rated 75% of the studies as low risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	All 13 studies reported some type of hospital mortality (28-day, 30-day, 60-day or ICU mortality).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	We considered studies of high-risk surgery patients (eight studies) and general intensive care patients (five studies) separately as subgroups for meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality for the studies of general intensive care patients was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.09) and for the studies of high-risk surgery patients the RR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.29).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	Of the eight studies of high-risk surgery patients, five evaluated the effectiveness of pre-operative optimization but there was no difference in mortality when these studies were examined separately.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	PAC did not affect general ICU LOS (reported by four studies) or hospital LOS (reported by nine studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	Four studies, conducted in the United States (US), reported costs based on hospital charges billed, which on average were higher in the PAC groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	Two of these studies qualified for analysis and did not show a statistically significant hospital cost difference (mean difference USD 900, 95% CI -2620 to 4420, P = 0.62).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	PAC is a diagnostic and haemodynamic monitoring tool but not a therapeutic intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	Our review concluded that use of a PAC did not alter the mortality, general ICU or hospital LOS, or cost for adult patients in intensive care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	The quality of evidence was high for mortality and LOS but low for cost analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	Efficacy studies are needed to determine if there are optimal PAC-guided management protocols, which when applied to specific patient groups in ICUs could result in benefits such as shock reversal, improved organ function and less vasopressor use.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3	Newer, less-invasive haemodynamic monitoring tools need to be validated against PAC prior to clinical use in critically ill patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001452.pub4	Six studies (n = 478) of variable quality were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001452.pub4	A composite outcome of Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), Neonatal Facial Action Coding System (NFCS) and/or Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score was reported in 288 infants, who did not receive a sweet tasting solution.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001452.pub4	Meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in the venepuncture versus the heel lance group (SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.52; I2 = 0%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001452.pub4	When a sweet tasting solution was provided the SMD remained significant favouring the venepuncture group (SMD - 0.38, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.07).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001452.pub4	The typical RD for requiring more than one skin puncture for venepuncture versus heel lance (reported in 4 studies; n = 254) was -0.34 (95% CI -0.43 to -0.25; I2 = 97%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001452.pub4	The NNT to avoid one repeat skin puncture was 3 (95% CI 2 to 4).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001452.pub4	Cry characteristics favoured the venepuncture group but the differences were reduced by the provision of sweet tasting solutions prior to either procedure.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD001452.pub4	The use of a sweet tasting solution further reduces the pain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001452.pub4	Further well designed randomised controlled trials should be conducted in settings where several individuals perform the procedures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008977.pub2	Two small studies of poor methodological quality including 52 women with a dehisced and/or infected episiotomy wound at point of entry have been included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008977.pub2	Only one small study presented data in relation to wound healing at less than four weeks, (the primary outcome measure for this review), although no reference was made to demonstrate how healing was measured.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008977.pub2	There was a trend to favour this outcome in the resuturing group, however, this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 3.88, one study, 17 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008977.pub2	Similarly, only one trial reported on rates of dyspareunia (a secondary outcome measure for this review) at two months and six months with no statistically significant difference between both groups; two months, (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.11, one study, 26 women) and six months, (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.87, one study 32 women).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008977.pub2	This trial also included data on the numbers of women who resumed sexual intercourse by two months and six months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008977.pub2	Significantly more women in the secondary suturing group had resumed intercourse by two months (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.89, one study, 35 women), although by six months there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 1.08, 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.28).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008977.pub2	Neither of the trials included data in relation to the following prespecified secondary outcome measures: pain at any time interval; the woman's satisfaction with the aesthetic results of the perineal wound; exclusive breastfeeding; maternal anxiety or depression.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008977.pub2	Based on this review, there is currently insufficient evidence available to either support or refute secondary suturing for the management of broken down perineal wounds following childbirth.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008977.pub2	There is an urgent need for a robust randomised controlled trial to evaluate fully the comparative effects of both treatment options.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	We included 18 studies involving 2521 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	The methodological quality of 17 included studies was poor.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	Included RCTs separately compared medicinal herbs with different antiviral drugs, precluding any pooling of results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	Only three indicated that compared with antiviral drugs, Chinese medicinal herbs may be effective in preventing influenza and alleviating influenza symptoms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	'Ganmao' capsules were found to be more effective than amantadine in decreasing influenza symptoms and speeding recovery in one study (in which adverse reactions were mentioned in the amantadine group although no data were reported).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	There were no significant differences between 'E Shu You' and ribavirin in treating influenza, nor in the occurrence of adverse reactions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	Ten studies reported mild adverse reactions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	Most Chinese medical herbs in the included studies showed similar effects to antiviral drugs in preventing or treating influenza.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	Few were shown to be superior to antiviral drugs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	No obvious adverse events were reported in the included studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	However, current evidence remains weak due to methodological limitations of the trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004559.pub4	More high-quality RCTs with larger numbers of participants and clear reporting are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Our search strategy identified 8 studies (580 participants) as eligible for inclusion in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over-the-wire catheter exchange (1); and over-the-wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	No two studies compared the same interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Based on low certainty evidence, thrombolytic therapy may restore catheter function when compared to placebo (149 participants: RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.56) but there is no data available to suggest an optimal dose or administration method.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	The certainty of this evidence is reduced due to the fact that it is based on only a single study with wide confidence limits, high risk of bias and imprecision in the estimates of adverse events (149 participants: RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.73).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Catheter patency is poor following use of thrombolytic agents with studies reporting median catheter survival rates of 14 to 42 days and was reported to improve significantly by fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange (37 participants: MD -27.70 days, 95% CI -51.00 to -4.40).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over-the-wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Pharmacological interventions appear to have a bridging role and long-term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical industry involvement.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2	Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most efficacious and clinically appropriate technique for HD catheter dysfunction.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003368.pub3	We identified 17 trials reporting on 22 treatment comparisons (2674 patients randomised).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003368.pub3	Fifteen trials (20 treatment comparisons) reported results for tumour response and 11 trials (14 treatment comparisons) published time-to-event data for overall survival.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003368.pub3	There were 1532 deaths in 2116 women randomised to trials of the addition of a drug to the regimen and control (the regimen alone).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003368.pub3	There was no detectable difference in overall survival between these patients, with an overall HR of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.07, P = 0.47) and no significant heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003368.pub3	We found no difference in time to progression between these regimens, with an overall HR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07, P = 0.31) and no significant heterogeneity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003368.pub3	Addition of a drug to the regimen was favourably associated with overall tumour response rates (odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44, P = 0.04) although we observed significant heterogeneity for this outcome across the trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003368.pub3	Where measured, acute toxicities such as alopecia, nausea and vomiting and leucopenia were more common with the addition of a drug.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003368.pub3	The addition of one or more drugs to the regimen shows a statistically significant advantage for tumour response in women with metastatic breast cancer but the results suggest no difference in survival time or time to progression.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003368.pub3	The positive effect on tumour response was also associated with increased toxicity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	Ten random or quasi-random controlled trials reported on a total of 1896 patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	There was no statistically significant effect on inpatient mortality (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.16) or mortality to longest follow up (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.29) but higher quality studies showed a larger non-significant increase in inpatient mortality (OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.68).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	Discharge to institutional care was reduced for the NLU (OR 0.44 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89) and functional status at discharge increased (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.54) but there was a near significant increase in inpatient stay (WMD 5.13 days 95% CI -0.5 days to 10.76 days).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	Early readmissions were reduced (OR 0.52 95% CI 0.34 to 0.80).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	One study compared a NLU for the chronically critically ill with ICU care.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	Mortality (OR 0.62 95% CI 0.35 to 1.10) and length of inpatient stay differ did not differ (WMD 2 days, 95% CI 10.96 to -6.96 days).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	Early readmissions were reduced (OR 0.33 95% CI 0.12 to 0.94).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	Costs of care on the NLU were higher for UK studies but lower for US based studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	There is some evidence that patients discharged from a NLU are better prepared for discharge but it is unclear if this is simply a product of an increased length of inpatient stay.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	No statistically significant adverse effects were noted but the possibility of increased early mortality cannot be discounted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002214.pub3	More research is needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	We included 11 studies including 414 participants in the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	Two trials compared therapeutic ultrasound with placebo, two compared one ultrasound regimen with another, two compared ultrasound with another non-surgical intervention, and six compared ultrasound as part of a multi-component intervention with another non-surgical intervention (for example, exercises and splint).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	The risk of bias was low in some studies and unclear or high in other studies, with only two reporting that the allocation sequence was concealed and six reporting that participants were blinded.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	Overall, there is insufficient evidence that one therapeutic ultrasound regimen is more efficacious than another.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	Only two studies reported the primary outcome of interest, short-term overall improvement (any measure in which patients indicate the intensity of their complaints compared with baseline, for example, global rating of improvement, satisfaction with treatment, within three months post-treatment).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	One low quality trial with 68 participants found that when compared with placebo, therapeutic ultrasound may increase the chance of experiencing short-term overall improvement at the end of seven weeks treatment (RR 2.36; 95% CI 1.40 to 3.98), although losses to follow-up and failure to adjust for the correlation between wrists in participants with bilateral CTS in this study suggest that this data should be interpreted with caution.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	Another low quality trial with 60 participants found that at three months post-treatment therapeutic ultrasound plus splint increased the chance of short-term overall improvement (patient satisfaction) when compared with splint alone (RR 3.02; 95% CI 1.36 to 6.72), but decreased the chance of short-term overall improvement when compared with low-level laser therapy plus splint (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.33), though participants were not blinded to treatment, it was unclear if the random allocation sequence was adequately concealed, and there was a potential unit of analysis error.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	Differences between groups receiving different frequencies and intensities of ultrasound, and between ultrasound as part of a multi-component intervention versus other non-surgical interventions, were generally small and not statistically significant for symptoms, function, and neurophysiologic parameters.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	No studies reported any adverse effects of therapeutic ultrasound, but this outcome was only measured in three studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	More adverse effects data are required before any firm conclusions on the safety of therapeutic ultrasound can be made.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	There is only poor quality evidence from very limited data to suggest that therapeutic ultrasound may be more effective than placebo for either short- or long-term symptom improvement in people with CTS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to support the greater benefit of one type of therapeutic ultrasound regimen over another or to support the use of therapeutic ultrasound as a treatment with greater efficacy compared to other non-surgical interventions for CTS, such as splinting, exercises, and oral drugs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009601.pub2	More methodologically rigorous studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of therapeutic ultrasound for CTS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002091.pub2	We included eight studies involving approximately 10,000 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002091.pub2	The active interventions were pravastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, clofibrate, and conjugated oestrogen.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002091.pub2	Fixed-effect analysis showed no overall effect on stroke recurrence but statin therapy alone had a marginal benefit in reducing subsequent cerebrovascular events in those with a previous history of stroke or TIA (odds ratio (OR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.00).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002091.pub2	There was no evidence that such intervention reduced all-cause mortality or sudden death (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.20).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002091.pub2	Three statin trials showed a reduction in subsequent serious vascular events (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002091.pub2	There is evidence that statin therapy in patients with a history of ischaemic stroke or TIA significantly reduces subsequent major coronary events but only marginally reduces the risk of stroke recurrence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002091.pub2	There is no clear evidence of beneficial effect from statins in those with previous haemorrhagic stroke and it is unclear whether statins should be started immediately post stroke or later.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002091.pub2	In view of this and the evidence of the benefit of statin therapy in those with a history of CHD, patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA, with or without a history of established CHD, should receive statins.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	Eleven campaigns met the inclusion criteria for this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	Studies differed in design, settings, duration, content and intensity of intervention, length of follow-up, methods of evaluation and also in definitions and measures of smoking behaviour used.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	Among seven campaigns reporting smoking prevalence, significant decreases were observed in the California and Massachusetts statewide tobacco control campaigns compared with the rest of the USA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	Some positive effects on prevalence in the whole population or in the subgroups were observed in three of the remaining seven studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	Three large-scale campaigns of the seven presenting results for tobacco consumption found statistically significant decreases.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	Among the eight studies presenting abstinence or quit rates, four showed some positive effect, although in one of them the effect was measured for quitting and cutting down combined.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	Among the three that did not show significant decreases, one demonstrated a significant intervention effect on smokers and ex-smokers combined.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	There is evidence that comprehensive tobacco control programmes which include mass media campaigns can be effective in changing smoking behaviour in adults, but the evidence comes from a heterogeneous group of studies of variable methodological quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	One state-wide tobacco control programme (Massachusetts) showed positive results up to eight years after the campaign.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	Another (California) showed positive results during the period of adequate funding and implementation and in final evaluation since the beginning of the programme.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	Six of nine studies carried out in communities or regions showed some positive effects on smoking behaviour and at least one significant change in smoking prevalence (Sydney).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	The intensity and duration of mass media campaigns may influence effectiveness, but length of follow-up and concurrent secular trends and events can make this difficult to quantify.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004704.pub4	No consistent relationship was observed between campaign effectiveness and age, education, ethnicity or gender.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	We included 24 studies with a total of 2166 participants, 23 of which provided data for meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	Thirteen studies had low risk of selection bias, five studies reported adequate blinding of outcome assessment and 15 studies had low risk of attrition bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	Seventeen studies that compared yoga versus no therapy provided moderate-quality evidence showing that yoga improved health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.40; 10 studies, 675 participants), reduced fatigue (pooled SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.20; 11 studies, 883 participants) and reduced sleep disturbances in the short term (pooled SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.09; six studies, 657 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	The funnel plot for health-related quality of life was asymmetrical, favouring no therapy, and the funnel plot for fatigue was roughly symmetrical.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	This hints at overall low risk of publication bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	Yoga did not appear to reduce depression (pooled SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.05; seven studies, 496 participants; low-quality evidence) or anxiety (pooled SMD -0.53, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.04; six studies, 346 participants; very low-quality evidence) in the short term and had no medium-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.42; two studies, 146 participants; low-quality evidence) or fatigue (pooled SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.29; two studies, 146 participants; low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	Investigators reported no serious adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	Four studies that compared yoga versus psychosocial/educational interventions provided moderate-quality evidence indicating that yoga can reduce depression (pooled SMD -2.29, 95% CI -3.97 to -0.61; four studies, 226 participants), anxiety (pooled SMD -2.21, 95% CI -3.90 to -0.52; three studies, 195 participants) and fatigue (pooled SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.50; two studies, 106 participants) in the short term.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	Very low-quality evidence showed no short-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.81, 95% CI -0.50 to 2.12; two studies, 153 participants) or sleep disturbances (pooled SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.34; two studies, 119 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	No trial adequately reported safety-related data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	Three studies that compared yoga versus exercise presented very low-quality evidence showing no short-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.23; three studies, 233 participants) or fatigue (pooled SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.25; three studies, 233 participants); no trial provided safety-related data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	Moderate-quality evidence supports the recommendation of yoga as a supportive intervention for improving health-related quality of life and reducing fatigue and sleep disturbances when compared with no therapy, as well as for reducing depression, anxiety and fatigue, when compared with psychosocial/educational interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010802.pub2	Very low-quality evidence suggests that yoga might be as effective as other exercise interventions and might be used as an alternative to other exercise programmes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	We included one retrospective, single-institution study that compared post-operative imaging within 48 hours (early post-operative imaging) with no early post-operative imaging among 125 people who had surgery for glioblastoma (GBM: World Health Organization (WHO) grade 4 glioma).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	Most patients in the study underwent maximal surgical resection followed by combined radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	Although patient characteristics in the study arms were comparable, the study was at high risk of bias overall.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	Evidence from this study suggested little or no difference between early and no early post-operative imaging with respect to overall survival (deaths) at one year after diagnosis of GBM (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.21; 48% vs 55% died, respectively; very low certainty evidence) and little or no difference in overall survival (deaths) at two years after diagnosis of GBM (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25; 86% vs 81% died, respectively; very low certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	No other review outcomes were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	We found no evidence on the effectiveness of other imaging schedules.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	In addition, we identified no relevant economic evaluations assessing the efficiency of the different imaging strategies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	The effect of different imaging strategies on survival and other health outcomes remains largely unknown.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	Existing imaging schedules in glioma seem to be pragmatic rather than evidence-based.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	The limited evidence suggesting that early post-operative brain imaging among GBM patients who will receive combined chemoradiation treatment may make little or no difference to survival needs to be further researched, particularly as early post-operative imaging also serves as a quality control measure that may lead to early re-operation if residual tumour is identified.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	Mathematical modelling of a large glioma patient database could help to distinguish the optimal timing of surveillance imaging for different types of glioma, with stratification of patients facilitated by assessment of individual tumour growth rates, molecular biomarkers and other prognostic factors.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013137.pub2	In addition, paediatric glioma study designs could be used to inform future research of imaging strategies among adults with glioma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011655.pub2	We included three studies randomising 161 people with schizophrenia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011655.pub2	Data were available for only two of our seven prestated main outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011655.pub2	Clinically important improvement in global state was measured using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011655.pub2	There was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and metiapine groups (2 RCTs, n = 120, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47, very low quality evidence) and numbers of participants with parkinsonism at eight weeks were similar (2 RCTs, n = 70, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.03, very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011655.pub2	There were no useable data available for the other key outcomes of clinically important improvement in mental state, readmission due to relapse, satisfaction with treatment, aggressive or violent behaviour, or cost of care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011655.pub2	Chlorpromazine has been the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia for decades, yet available evidence comparing this drug to metiapine fails to provide high-quality trial based data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011655.pub2	However, the need to determine whether metiapine is more or less effective than chlorpromazine seems to be lacking in clinical relevance and future research on this comparison seems unlikely.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	Twenty-three studies were identified for inclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	Probiotics were not superior to placebo for any outcome measured.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	The use of nitroimidazole antibiotics appeared to reduce the risk of clinical (RR 0.23; 95%CI 0.09 to 0.57, NNT=4) and endoscopic (RR 0.44; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.74, NNT = 4) recurrence relative to placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	However, these agents were associated with higher risk of serious adverse events (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.7).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	Mesalamine therapy was associated with a significantly reduced risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, NNT = 12), and severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.84, NNT = 8) when compared to placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	Azathioprine/6MP was also associated with a significantly reduced risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92, NNT = 7), and severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92, NNT = 4), when compared to placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	Neither agent had a higher risk than placebo of serious adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	When compared to azathioprine/6MP, mesalamine was associated with a higher risk of any endoscopic recurrence (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.06), but a lower risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.89).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	There was no significant difference between mesalamine and azathioprine/6MP for any other outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	There are insufficient randomised controlled trials of infliximab, budesonide, tenovil and interleukin-10 to draw conclusions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	Nitro-imidazole antibiotics, mesalamine and immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine/6-MP or infliximab all appear to be superior to placebo for the prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2	The cost, toxicity and tolerability of these approaches require careful consideration to determine the optimal approach for post-operative prophylaxis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	We included seven trials (825 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	We judged the majority of the trials to have a high or unclear risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	The psychosocial interventions considered in the studies were: cognitive-behavioural coping skills training (one study), twelve-step programme (one study), brief intervention (three studies), motivational interviewing (two studies), and brief motivational interviewing (one study).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	Two studies were considered in two comparisons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	There were no data for the secondary outcome, alcohol-related harm.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	The results were as follows.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	Comparison 1: cognitive-behavioural coping skills training versus twelve-step programme (one study, 41 participants)	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	There was no significant difference between groups for either of the primary outcomes (alcohol abstinence assessed with Substance Abuse Calendar and breathalyser at one year: risk ratio (RR) 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10 to 55.06); and retention in treatment, measured at end of treatment: RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.29), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was very low.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	There was no significant difference between groups for either of the primary outcomes (alcohol use, measured as scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) or Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) at three months: standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07 (95% CI -0.24 to 0.37); and retention in treatment, measured at three months: RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.13), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was low.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	Comparison 4: brief motivational intervention (BMI) versus assessment only (one study, 187 participants)	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	More people reduced alcohol use (by seven or more days in the past month, measured at six months) in the BMI group than in the control group (RR 1.67; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.60).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	There was no difference between groups for the other primary outcome, retention in treatment, measured at end of treatment: RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.02), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was moderate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	Comparison 5: motivational interviewing (intensive) versus motivational interviewing (one study, 163 participants)	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	There was no significant difference between groups for either of the primary outcomes (alcohol use, measured using the Addiction Severity Index-alcohol score (ASI) at two months: MD 0.03 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.08); and retention in treatment, measured at end of treatment: RR 17.63 (95% CI 1.03 to 300.48), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	We found low to very low-quality evidence to suggest that there is no difference in effectiveness between different types of psychosocial interventions to reduce alcohol consumption among people who use illicit drugs, and that brief interventions are not superior to assessment-only or to treatment as usual.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009269.pub4	No firm conclusions can be made because of the paucity of the data and the low quality of the retrieved studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	We identified 23 trials with a total of 1586 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Fifty-eight per cent of these participants were from five unpublished studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Quinine was compared to placebo (20 trials, n = 1140), vitamin E (four trials, n = 543), a quinine-vitamin E combination (three trials, n = 510), a quinine-theophylline combination (one trial, n = 77), and xylocaine injections into the gastrocnemius muscle (one trial, n = 24).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	The most commonly used quinine dosage was 300 mg/day (range 200 to 500 mg).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	We found no new trials for inclusion when searches were updated in 2014.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	The risk of bias in the trials varied considerably.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	All 23 trials claimed to be randomised, but only a minority described randomisation and allocation concealment adequately.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Compared to placebo, quinine significantly reduced cramp number over two weeks by 28%, cramp intensity by 10%, and cramp days by 20%.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Cramp duration was not significantly affected.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	A significantly greater number of people suffered minor adverse events on quinine than placebo (risk difference (RD) 3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0% to 6%), mainly gastrointestinal symptoms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Overdoses of quinine have been reported elsewhere to cause potentially fatal adverse effects, but in the included trials there was no significant difference in major adverse events compared with placebo (RD 0%, 95% CI -1% to 2%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	One participant suffered from thrombocytopenia (0.12% risk) on quinine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	A quinine-vitamin E combination, vitamin E alone, and xylocaine injections into gastrocnemius were not significantly different to quinine across all outcomes, including adverse effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Based on a single trial comparison, quinine alone was significantly less effective than a quinine-theophylline combination but with no significant differences in adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	There is moderate quality evidence that with use up to 60 days, the incidence of serious adverse events is not significantly greater than for placebo in the identified trials, but because serious adverse events can be rarely fatal, in some countries prescription of quinine is severely restricted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Evidence from single trials suggests that theophylline combined with quinine improves cramps more than quinine alone, and the effects of xylocaine injections into gastrocnemius are not significantly different to quinine across all outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Low or moderate quality evidence shows no significant difference between quinine and vitamin E or quinine and quinine-vitamin E mixture.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Further research into these alternatives, as well other pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, is thus warranted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	There is no evidence to judge optimal dosage or duration of quinine treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Further studies using different dosages and measurement of serum quinine levels will allow a therapeutic range to be defined for muscle cramp.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Because serious adverse events are not common, large population studies are required to more accurately inform incidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	Longer lengths of follow-up in future trials will help determine the duration of action following cessation of quinine as well as long-term adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005044.pub3	The search for new therapies, pharmacological and nonpharmacological, should continue and further trials should compare vitamin E, quinine-vitamin E combination, and quinine-theophylline mixture with quinine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	We identified seven trials (five parallel, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 406 individuals amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	Three trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (N = 202) and four trials enrolled idiopathic cramp sufferers (N = 322 including cross-over controls).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	Magnesium was compared to placebo in six trials and to no treatment in one trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	For idiopathic cramps (largely older adults presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps), differences in measures of cramp frequency, magnesium versus placebo, were small, not statistically significant, and without heterogeneity (I2 = 0%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (-3.93%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.12% to 13.26%, moderate quality evidence) and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (0.01 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.55, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different, being 8% lower in the magnesium group (95% CI -28% to 12%, moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity (moderate quality evidence) or cramp duration (low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	Meta-analysis was not possible for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	The two trials comparing magnesium to placebo differed in that one trial found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures while the other found benefit for both.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	Withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different than placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	While we could not determine the number of subjects with minor adverse events, studies of oral magnesium generally described potential side effects as similar in frequency to placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this patient population is needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2	We found no randomized controlled trials evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	We included one RCT that studied the effects of a six-month, home-based, combined muscle strength and recumbent cycle ergometry training program versus usual care in 14 ambulatory people with SMA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The age range of the participants was between 10 years and 48 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The study was evaluator-blinded, but personnel and participants could not be blinded to the intervention, which placed the results at a high risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	Participants performed strength training as prescribed, but 50% of the participants did not achieve the intended aerobic exercise training regimen.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The trial used change in walking distance on the six-minute walk test as a measure of function; a minimal detectable change is 24.0 m.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The change from baseline to six months' follow-up in the training group (9.4 m) was not detectably different from the change in the usual care group (-0.14 m) (mean difference (MD) 9.54 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -83.04 to 102.12; N = 12).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, assessed by the change from baseline to six months' follow-up in peak oxygen uptake (VO2max) was similar in the training group (-0.12 mL/kg/min) and the usual care group (-1.34 mL/kg/min) (MD 1.22 mL/kg/min, 95% CI -2.16 to 4.6; N = 12).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	A clinically meaningful increase in VO2max is 3.5 mL/kg/min.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The trial assessed function on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE), which has a range of possible scores from 0 to 66, with an increase of 3 or more points indicating clinically meaningful improvement.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The HFMSE score in the training group increased by 2 points from baseline to six months' follow-up, with no change in the usual care group (MD 2.00, 95% CI -2.06 to 6.06; N = 12).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The training group showed a slight improvement in muscle strength, expressed as the manual muscle testing (MMT) total score, which ranges from 28 (weakest) to 280 (strongest).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The change from baseline in MMT total score was 6.8 in the training group compared to -5.14 in the usual care group (MD 11.94, 95% CI -3.44 to 27.32; N = 12).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The trial stated that training had no statistically significant effects on fatigue and quality of life.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low because of study limitations and imprecision.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	The study did not assess the effects of physical exercise training on physical activity levels.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	No study-related serious adverse events or adverse events leading to withdrawal occurred, but we cannot draw wider conclusions from this very low-certainty evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	It is uncertain whether combined strength and aerobic exercise training is beneficial or harmful in people with SMA type 3, as the quality of evidence is very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012120.pub2	We need well-designed and adequately powered studies using protocols that meet international standards for the development of training interventions, in order to improve our understanding of the exercise response in people with SMA type 3 and eventually develop exercise guidelines for this condition.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3	Two trials (N = 149) were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3	In both trials, allocation concealment was inadequate and arrangements for blinding of outcome assessment were unclear.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3	One trial (81 patients with cervical radiculopathy) found that surgical decompression was superior to physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in the short-term for pain, weakness or sensory loss; at one year, there were no significant differences between groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3	One trial (68 patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy) found no significant differences between surgery and conservative treatment in three years following treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3	A substantial proportion of cases were lost to follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3	Both small trials had significant risks of bias and do not provide reliable evidence on the effects of surgery for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3	It is unclear whether the short-term risks of surgery are offset by long-term benefits.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3	Further research is very likely to have an impact on the estimate of effect and our confidence in it.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3	There is low quality evidence that surgery may provide pain relief faster than physiotherapy or hard collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy; but there is little or no difference in the long-term.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3	There is very low quality evidence that patients with mild myelopathy feel subjectively better shortly after surgery, but there is little or no difference in the long-term.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004180.pub2	Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, five RCTs, one CCT and three ITSs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004180.pub2	Six studies compared telephone consultation versus normal care; four by a doctor, one by a nurse and one by a clinic clerk.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004180.pub2	Three studies compared telephone consultation by different types of health care workers; two compared nurses with doctors and one compared health assistants with doctors or nurses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004180.pub2	Three of five studies found a decrease in visits to GP's but two found a significant increase in return consultations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004180.pub2	In general at least 50% of calls were handled by telephone advice alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004180.pub2	Seven studies looked at accident and emergency department visits, six showed no difference between the groups and one, of nurse telephone consultation, found an increase in visits.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004180.pub2	Two studies reported deaths and found no difference between nurse telephone triage and normal care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004180.pub2	Telephone consultation appears to reduce the number of surgery contacts and out-of-hours visits by general practitioners.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004180.pub2	However, questions remain about its affect on service use and further rigorous evaluation is needed with emphasis on service use, safety, cost and patient satisfaction.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	We included a total of 84 trials (22,872 participants), with 70/84 studies reporting interventions in higher risk individuals or settings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	Studies with follow-up periods of at least four months were of more interest in assessing the sustainability of intervention effects and were also less susceptible to short-term reporting or publication bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	Overall, the risk of bias assessment showed that these studies provided moderate or low quality evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	At four or more months follow-up, we found effects in favour of MI for the quantity of alcohol consumed (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.15 to −0.06 or a reduction from 13.7 drinks/week to 12.5 drinks/week; moderate quality evidence); frequency of alcohol consumption (SMD −0.14, 95% CI −0.21 to −0.07 or a reduction in the number of days/week alcohol was consumed from 2.74 days to 2.52 days; moderate quality evidence); and peak blood alcohol concentration, or BAC (SMD −0.12, 95% CI −0.20 to 0.05, or a reduction from 0.144% to 0.131%; moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	We found a marginal effect in favour of MI for alcohol problems (SMD −0.08, 95% CI −0.17 to 0.00 or a reduction in an alcohol problems scale score from 8.91 to 8.18; low quality evidence) and no effects for binge drinking (SMD −0.04, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.02, moderate quality evidence) or for average BAC (SMD −0.05, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.08; moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	We also considered other alcohol-related behavioural outcomes, and at four or more months follow-up, we found no effects on drink-driving (SMD −0.13, 95% CI −0.36 to 0.10; moderate quality of evidence) or other alcohol-related risky behaviour (SMD −0.15, 95% CI −0.31 to 0.01; moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	Further analyses showed that there was no clear relationship between the duration of the MI intervention (in minutes) and effect size.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	Subgroup analyses revealed no clear subgroup effects for longer-term outcomes (four or more months) for assessment only versus alternative intervention controls; for university/college vs other settings; or for higher risk vs all/low risk participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	None of the studies reported harms related to MI.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	The results of this review indicate that there are no substantive, meaningful benefits of MI interventions for preventing alcohol use, misuse or alcohol-related problems.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	Although we found some statistically significant effects, the effect sizes were too small, given the measurement scales used in the included studies, to be of relevance to policy or practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007025.pub4	Moreover, the statistically significant effects are not consistent for all misuse measures, and the quality of evidence is not strong, implying that any effects could be inflated by risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	This review includes 29 parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 2210), although not all reported relevant or useable data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	All participants had asthma, and follow-up ranged from 2 to 26 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Most studies were at low or unclear risk of selection and attrition biases and at high risk for biases associated with blinding.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	We considered most of the evidence to be of low quality owing to these biases and to imprecision in the estimates of effect.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	We classified studies into three comparisons: enhanced face-to-face training session(s), multi-media-delivered inhaler training (e.g. DVD, computer app or game) and technique feedback devices.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Differences between interventions, populations and outcome measures limited quantitative analyses, particularly for exacerbations, adverse events, unscheduled visits to a healthcare provider and absenteeism from work or school.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Enhanced inhaler technique education and multi-media training improved technique in most studies immediately after the intervention and at follow-up, although the variety of checklists used meant that this was difficult to assess reliably.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	For both adults and children, how and when inhaler technique was assessed appeared to affect whether inhaler technique improved and by how much.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Analyses of the numbers of people who demonstrated correct or 'good enough' technique were generally more useful than checklist scores.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Adult studies of enhanced education showed benefit when this metric was used at 2 to 26 weeks' follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 5.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 13.65; 258 participants; three studies; 31 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 69 (95% CI 45 to 86) in the education group; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	A similar result was seen in studies looking at feedback devices at four weeks' follow-up (OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.87 to 12.33; 97 participants; one study; 51 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 83 (95% CI 66 to 93) in the feedback group; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	However, the benefit of multi-media training for adults even immediately after the intervention was uncertain (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 5.50; 164 participants; two studies; I² = 49%; 30 per 100 in the control group with correct technique compared with 47 (95% CI 26 to 70) in the multi-media group; moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Evidence tended to be less clear for children, usually because results were based on fewer and smaller studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Some studies did not report exacerbations in a way that allowed meta-analysis; others provided inconclusive results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Inhaler technique interventions provided some benefit for asthma control and quality of life but generally did not lead to consistent or important clinical benefits for adults or children.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Confidence intervals included no difference or did not reach a threshold that could be considered clinically important.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Responder analyses sometimes showed improvement among more people in the intervention groups, even though the mean difference between groups was small.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	We found no evidence about harms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Although interventions to improve inhaler technique may work in some circumstances, the variety of interventions and measurement methods used hampered our ability to perform meta-analyses and led to low to moderate confidence in our findings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Most included studies did not report important improvement in clinical outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012286.pub2	Guidelines consistently recommend that clinicians check regularly the inhaler technique of their patients; what is not clear is how clinicians can most effectively intervene if they find a patient's technique to be inadequate, and whether such interventions will have a discernible impact on clinical outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	Three small trials, involving 226 participants, were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	One trial included patients with presumed ischaemic stroke without computerised tomography (CT) verification, and the other two trials included patients with CT-verified ICH.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	Data on the primary outcome measure (death and dependency) were not available in any of the trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	Death and disability could be calculated in the larger ICH trial without differences between the mannitol and control groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	Case fatality was not reported in the trial of ischaemic stroke.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	Case fatality did not differ between the mannitol and control groups in the ICH trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	Adverse events were either not found or not reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	The change in clinical condition was reported in two trials, and the proportion of those with worsening or not improving condition did not differ significantly between mannitol-treated patients and controls.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	Based on these three trials neither beneficial nor harmful effects of mannitol could be proved.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	Although no statistically significant differences were found between the mannitol-treated and control groups, the confidence intervals for the treatment effect estimates were wide and included both clinically significant benefits and clinically significant harms as possibilities.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	There is currently not enough evidence to support the routine use of mannitol in acute stroke patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001153.pub2	Further trials are needed to confirm or refute whether mannitol is beneficial in acute stroke.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001460	Six trials were identified, with 425 patients randomized to D-penicillamine and 258 to placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001460	A statistically significant benefit was observed for D-penicillamine when compared to placebo for all three-dose ranges and for most outcome measures including: tender joint counts, pain, physician's global assessments and ESR.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001460	The standardized weighted mean differences between treatment and placebo in moderate doses were -0.51 [95% CI -0.88, -0.14] for tender joint counts, -0.56 (95% CI -0.87, -0.26) for pain and -0.97 (95% CI -1.25, -0.70) for global assessment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001460	The difference for ESR was -10.6 mm/hr. Similar results were observed for the higher dose group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001460	Total withdrawals were significantly higher in the moderate and high dosage D-penicillamine groups (OR=1.63 and 2.13 respectively), mostly due to increased adverse reactions (OR = 2.60 and 4.95 respectively), including renal and hematological abnormalities.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001460	D-penicillamine appears to have a clinically and statistically significant benefit on the disease activity of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001460	Its efficacy appears to be similar to that of other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but with a significantly higher toxicity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001460	Its effects on long-term functional status and radiological progression are not clear from this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	We included four relevant trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	All of them were of low quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	All of studies used a decoction containing Huangqi compounds as the intervention with chemotherapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	The intervention groups of three studies were compared to a chemotherapy alone control group, the fourth study compared the decoction of Huangqi compounds with two other Chinese herbal interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	None of the studies reported on primary outcome using Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	There was a significant reduction in the proportion of patients who experienced nausea & vomiting when decoctions of Huangqi compounds were given in addition to chemotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	There was also a decrease in the rate of leucopenia (WBC <3 x 10^9 per L).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	Huangqi compounds were also associated with increases in the proportions of T-lymphocyte subsets: CD3; CD4 and CD8. Huangqi decoctions had no significant effects on Immunoglobulins G, A or M. Despite the included studies being of low quality, the results suggest that decoctions of Huangqi compounds may stimulate immunocompetent cells and decrease side effects in patients treated with chemotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	Due to the methodological limitations of the studies, there is no robust demonstration of benefit.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	We found no evidence of harm arising from the use of Chinese herbs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004540.pub2	We need high quality randomised controlled studies investigating the effects of decoctions of Chinese herbs, particularly Astragalus spp.(as in Huangqi), upon chemotherapy-related side effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	We reviewed 394 titles and abstracts and nine ClinicalTrials.gov records and included three RCTs that met our eligibility criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	The three trials included a total of 866 participants aged four to 55 years with RP of all forms of genetic predisposition.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	One trial evaluated the effect of vitamin A alone, one trial evaluated DHA alone, and a third trial evaluated DHA and vitamin A versus vitamin A alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	None of the RCTs had protocols available, so selective reporting bias was unclear for all.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	In addition, one trial did not specify the method for random sequence generation, so there was an unclear risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	All three trials were graded as low risk of bias for all other domains.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	We did not perform meta-analysis due to clinical heterogeneity of participants and interventions across the included trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	The primary outcome, mean change of visual field from baseline at one year, was not reported in any of the studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	No toxicity or adverse events were reported in these three trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	No trial reported a statistically significant benefit of vitamin supplementation on the progression of visual field loss or visual acuity loss.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	Two of the three trials reported statistically significant differences in ERG amplitudes among some subgroups of participants, but these results have not been replicated or substantiated by findings in any of the other trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	Based on the results of three RCTs, there is no clear evidence for benefit of treatment with vitamin A and/or DHA for people with RP, in terms of the mean change in visual field and ERG amplitudes at one year and the mean change in visual acuity at five years follow-up.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	In future RCTs, since some of the studies in this review included unplanned subgroup analysis that suggested differential effects based on previous vitamin A exposure, investigators should consider examining this issue.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008428.pub2	Future trials should take into account the changes observed in ERG amplitudes and other outcome measures from trials included in this review, in addition to previous cohort studies, when calculating sample sizes to assure adequate power to detect clinically and statistically meaningful difference between treatment arms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	We included three RCTs with a total of 414 participants at risk of job loss.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	The majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	The interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning in several ways: firstly by evaluating work changes or adaptations and secondly by providing any person-directed interventions including vocational counselling, advice or education.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	Interventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits (one trial) or any actions by an occupational physician (one trial).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	The duration or dose of the interventions varied from two 1.5-hour sessions (one RCT) over five months, two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months (one RCT), to six to eight individual or group sessions over six months (also one RCT).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	All participants were recruited through rheumatology clinics, both in or outside hospitals.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	Included trials investigated job loss (n = two RCTs; 382 participants), work absenteeism and work functioning (n = one RCT; 32 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	Overall, we evaluated the two smaller trials as having a high risk of bias and the large trial as having a low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	Trials showed marked differences in how they performed on risk of bias items, particularly on performance bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach and judged there to be very low quality evidence across the three reported outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	Of the two RCTs investigating job loss, the larger one (n = 242 participants) reported a large statistically significant reduction in job loss (relative risk (RR) = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.68) and the other RCT (n = 140) reported similar effects in both groups, although the CI was very wide (RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.06).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	The latter one probably suffered from performance bias and we judged it to have a high risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	The one small trial investigating sickness absenteeism found uncertain results at six months' follow-up (MD = -2.42 days, 95% CI -5.03 to 0.19).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	Finally, in the same small trial investigating work functioning using the Rheumatoid Arthritis-Work Instability Scale (RA-WIS), there was a moderate improvement of intermediate term work functioning (six months; scale range 0 to 23; mean improvement -4.67 points, 95% CI -8.43 to -0.91).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	We identified no adverse effects in the publications of the three trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	This Cochrane review of three RCTs found very low quality evidence overall for job loss prevention interventions having an effect on job loss, work absenteeism and work functioning in workers with inflammatory arthritis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010208.pub2	While this review highlights that further high quality RCTs are required, the results suggest that these strategies have potential to be effective.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	We identified three eligible studies that included a total of 285 neonates (140 received arginine) from three countries.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as good.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	We noted a statistically significant reduction in risk of development of NEC (any stage) among preterm neonates in the arginine group compared with the placebo group (RR 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.64; I2 = 27%) (RD -0.19, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.10; I2 = 0%) and rated the quality of evidence as moderate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) as required to prevent the development of NEC (any stage) was 6 (95% CI 4 to 10).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	Study results showed a statistically significant reduction in risk of development of NEC stage 1	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	(RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.90; I2 = 52%) (RD -0.07, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.01; I2 = 0%) and NEC stage 3 (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.03; I2 = 0%) (RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.01; I2 = 89%) in the arginine group compared with the control group; the quality of evidence was moderate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	Arginine supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in death related to NEC (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.00; I2 = 0%) (RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.01; I2 = 87%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	Results showed clinical heterogeneity in mortality rates.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	Mortality due to any cause was not significantly different between arginine and control or no treatment groups (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.45; I2 = 42%) (RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.04; I2 = 79%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	Investigators noted no significant side effects directly attributable to arginine, including hypotension or alterations in glucose homeostasis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	Follow-up data from one trial revealed no statistically significant differences in adverse outcomes (cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, bilateral blindness or hearing loss requiring hearing aids) at 36 months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	Limitations of the present findings include a relatively small overall sample size.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	Administration of arginine to preterm infants may prevent development of NEC.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	Because information was provided by three small trials that included 285 participants, the data are insufficient at present to support a practice recommendation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004339.pub4	A multi-centre randomised controlled study that is focused on the incidence of NEC, particularly at more severe stages (2 and 3), is needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005149.pub4	No new trials were found for inclusion in this update.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005149.pub4	Four studies involving 1943 participants with acute sinusitis met our inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005149.pub4	The trials were well-designed and double-blind and studied INCS versus placebo or no intervention for 15 or 21 days.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005149.pub4	The rates of loss to follow-up were 7%, 11%, 41% and 10%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005149.pub4	When we combined the results from the three trials included in the meta-analysis, participants receiving INCS were more likely to experience resolution or improvement in symptoms than those receiving placebo (73% versus 66.4%; risk ratio (RR) 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.18).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005149.pub4	Higher doses of INCS had a stronger effect on improvement of symptoms or complete relief: for mometasone furoate 400 µg versus 200 µg (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.18 versus RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.11).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005149.pub4	No significant adverse events were reported and there was no significant difference in the drop-out and recurrence rates for the two treatment groups and for groups receiving higher doses of INCS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005149.pub4	Current evidence is limited for acute sinusitis confirmed by radiology or nasal endoscopy but supports the use of INCS as a monotherapy or as an adjuvant therapy to antibiotics.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005149.pub4	Clinicians should weigh the modest but clinically important benefits against possible minor adverse events when prescribing therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001971	The administration of prophylactic vancomycin reduced the incidence of both total neonatal nosocomial sepsis and coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in eligible preterm infants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001971	Mortality, length of stay, and evidence of vancomycin toxicity were not significantly different between the two groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001971	There was insufficient evidence to ascertain the risks of development of vancomycin resistant organisms in the nurseries involved in these trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001971	The use of prophylactic vancomycin in low doses reduces the incidence of nosocomial sepsis in the neonate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001971	The methodologies of these studies may have contributed to the low rate of sepsis in the treated groups, as the blood cultures drawn from central lines may have failed to grow due to the low levels of vancomycin in the infusate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001971	Although there is a theoretical concern regarding the development of resistant organisms with the administration of prophylactic antibiotic, there is insufficient evidence to ascertain the risks of development of vancomycin resistant organisms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001971	Few clinically important benefits have been demonstrated for very low birth weight infants treated with prophylactic vancomycin.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001971	It therefore appears that routine prophylaxis with vancomycin should not be undertaken at present.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	Fourteen reports of 13 RCTs on dressings or topical agents for postoperative wounds healing by secondary intention were identified.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	WOUND HEALING: Whilst a single small trial of aloe vera supplementation vs gauze suggests delayed healing with aloe vera, the results of this trial are un interpretable since there was a large differential loss to follow up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	A plaster cast applied to an amputation stump accelerated wound healing compared with elastic compression, WMD -25.60 days, 95% CI -49.08 to -2.12 days (1 trial).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	There were no statistically significant differences in healing for other dressing comparisons (e.g. gauze, foam, alginate; 11 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	PAIN: Gauze was associated with significantly more pain for patients than other dressings (4 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	PATIENT SATISFACTION: Patients treated with gauze were less satisfied compared with those receiving alternative dressings (3 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	COSTS: Gauze is inexpensive but its use is associated with the use of significantly more nursing time than foam (2 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	LENGTH OF HOSPITAL STAY: Four trials showed no difference in length of hospital stay.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	One trial found shorter hospital stay in people after amputation when plaster casts were applied compared with elastic compression (WMD -30.10 days; 95% CI -49.82 to -10.38).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	We found only small, poor quality trials; the evidence is therefore insufficient to determine whether the choice of dressing or topical agent affects the healing of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003554.pub2	Foam is best studied as an alternative for gauze and appears to be preferable as to pain reduction, patient satisfaction and nursing time.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	In 2014, we added seven trials for a new total of 11.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Five reports were published before 1985 and six from 2005 to 2014.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	They included 1482 women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Four trials examined combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and three studied a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	We found two trials of progestin-only pills (POPs) and two of the etonogestrel-releasing implant.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Older studies often lacked quantified results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Most trials did not report significant differences between the study arms in breastfeeding duration, breast milk composition, or infant growth.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Exceptions were seen mainly in older studies with limited information.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	For breastfeeding duration, two of eight trials indicated a negative effect on lactation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	A COC study reported a negative effect on lactation duration compared to placebo but did not quantify results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Another trial showed a lower percentage of the LNG-IUS group breastfeeding at 75 days versus the nonhormonal IUD group (reported P < 0.05) but no significant difference at one year.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	For breast milk volume, two older studies indicated lower volume for the COC group versus the placebo group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	One trial did not quantify results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	The other showed lower means (mL) for the COC group, e.g. at 16 weeks (MD -24.00, 95% CI -34.53 to -13.47) and at 24 weeks (MD -24.90, 95% CI -36.01 to -13.79).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Another four trials did not report any significant difference between the study groups in milk volume or composition with two POPs, a COC, or the etonogestrel implant.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Seven trials studied infant growth; one showed greater weight gain (grams) for the etonogestrel implant versus no method for six weeks (MD 426.00, 95% CI 58.94 to 793.06) but less compared with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) from 6 to 12 weeks (MD -271.00, 95% CI -355.10 to -186.90).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	The others studied POPs, COCs versus POPs, or an LNG-IUS.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Results were not consistent across the 11 trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	The evidence was limited for any particular hormonal method.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	The quality of evidence was moderate overall and low for three of four placebo-controlled trials of COCs or POPs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	The sensitivity analysis included six trials with moderate quality evidence and sufficient outcome data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Five trials indicated no significant difference between groups in breastfeeding duration (etonogestrel implant insertion times, COC versus POP, and LNG-IUS).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	For breast milk volume or composition, a COC study showed a negative effect, while an implant trial showed no significant difference.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	Of four trials that assessed infant growth, three indicated no significant difference between groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003988.pub2	One showed greater weight gain in the etonogestrel implant group versus no method but less versus DMPA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003862.pub2	No randomised controlled trials were identified but 10 controlled before-after studies from Australia, Singapore and the USA met our inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003862.pub2	We grouped them according to the extent to which they adjusted for regression to the mean (RTM) and spillover effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003862.pub2	Total casualty crashes: the only study that adjusted for both reported a rate ratio of 0.71 (95% CI to 0.55, 0.93); for three that partially adjusted for RTM but failed to consider spillover, rate ratio was 0.87 (95% CI to 0.77, 0.98); one that made no adjustments had a rate ratio of 0.80 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.12).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003862.pub2	Right-angle casualty crashes: rate ratio for two studies that partially addressed RTM was 0.76 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.07).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003862.pub2	Total crashes: the study addressing both RTM and spillover reported a rate ratio of 0.93 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.05); one study that partially addressed RTM had a rate ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.15); the pooled rate ratio from the five studies with no adjustments was 0.74 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.03).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003862.pub2	Red-light violations: one study found a rate ratio of 0.53 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.66).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003862.pub2	Red-light cameras are effective in reducing total casualty crashes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003862.pub2	The evidence is less conclusive on total collisions, specific casualty collision types and violations, where reductions achieved could be explained by the play of chance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003862.pub2	Most evaluations did not adjust for RTM or spillover, affecting their accuracy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003862.pub2	Larger and better controlled studies are needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007699.pub3	Four trials involving 494 participants were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007699.pub3	Three studies involving 383 participants provided data on the proportion of participants who had achieved a therapeutic INR by day five.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007699.pub3	Significant benefit of a 10-mg warfarin nomogram was observed (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.54; moderate quality evidence), although with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 90%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007699.pub3	The review authors analyzed each study separately because it was not possible to perform a subgroup analysis by inpatient or outpatient status.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007699.pub3	One study showed significant benefit of a 10-mg warfarin nomogram for the proportion of outpatients with VTE who had achieved a therapeutic INR by day five (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.25), with the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB = 3, 95% CI 2 to 4); another study showed significant benefit of a 5-mg warfarin nomogram in outpatients with VTE (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.93) with NNTB = 5 (95% CI 3 to 28); a third study, consisting of both inpatients and outpatients, showed no difference (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.80).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007699.pub3	No difference was observed in recurrent venous thromboembolism at 90 days when the warfarin nomogram of 10 mg was compared with the warfarin nomogram of 5 mg (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.39 to 5.56; 3 studies, 362 participants, low quality evidence); no difference was observed in major bleeding at 14 to 90 days (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.51; 4 studies, 494 participants, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007699.pub3	No difference was observed in minor bleeding at 14 to 90 days (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.83; 2 studies, 243 participants, very low quality evidence) or in length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -2.3 days, 95% CI -7.96 to 3.36; 1 study, 111 participants, low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007699.pub3	In patients with acute thromboembolism (DVT or PE) aged 18 years or older, considerable uncertainty surrounds the use of a 10-mg or a 5-mg loading dose for initiation of warfarin to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 on the fifth day of therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007699.pub3	Heterogeneity among analyzed studies, mainly caused by differences in types of study participants and length of follow-up, limits certainty surrounding optimal warfarin initiation nomograms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	We included seven trials with a total of 555 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	Three trials compared models of enhanced care in the inpatient setting with conventional care.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	Two trials compared an enhanced care model provided in inpatient settings and at home after discharge with conventional care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	Two trials compared geriatrician-led care in-hospital to conventional care led by the orthopaedic team.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	None of the interventions were designed specifically for people with dementia, therefore the data included in the review were from subgroups of people with dementia or cognitive impairment participating in randomised controlled trials investigating models of care for all older people following hip fracture.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	The end of follow-up in the trials ranged from the point of acute hospital discharge to 24 months after discharge.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	We considered all trials to be at high risk of bias in more than one domain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	As subgroups of larger trials, the analyses lacked power to detect differences between the intervention groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	Furthermore, there were some important differences in baseline characteristics of participants between the experimental and control groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	Using the GRADE approach, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to low or very low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	The effect estimates for almost all comparisons were very imprecise, and the overall certainty for most results was very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	There were no data from any study for our primary outcome of health-related quality of life.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	There was only very low certainty for our other primary outcome, activities of daily living and functional performance, therefore we were unable to draw any conclusions with confidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	There was low-certainty that enhanced care and rehabilitation in-hospital may reduce rates of postoperative delirium (odds ratio 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.22, 2 trials, n = 141) and very low-certainty associating it with lower rates of some other complications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	There was also low-certainty that, compared to orthopaedic-led management, geriatrician-led management may lead to shorter hospital stays (mean difference 4.00 days, 95% CI 3.61 to 4.39, 1 trial, n = 162).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	We found limited evidence that some of the models of enhanced rehabilitation and care used in the included trials may show benefits over usual care for preventing delirium and reducing length of stay for people with dementia who have been treated for hip fracture.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	However, the certainty of these results is low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	Data were available from only a small number of trials, and the certainty for all other results is very low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3	Determining the optimal strategies to improve outcomes for this growing population of patients should be a research priority.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	We screened 4226 titles to yield seven RCTs with a total of 840 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	Participants, interventions and outcomes were diverse.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	No significant differences were reported in health outcomes; two studies reported a reduction in the hospital stay with no difference in the hospital readmission rates.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	Three studies reported a reduction in parental anxiety and improvement in child behaviours was reported in three studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	Overall increased parental satisfaction was reported in three studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	Also, better parental coping and family functioning was reported in one study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	By contrast, one study each reported no impact on parental burden of care or on functional status of children.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	Home care was reported as more costly for service providers with substantial cost savings for the family in two studies, while one study revealed no significant cost benefits for the family.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	Current research does not provide supporting evidence for a reduction in access to hospital services or a reduction in hospital readmission rate for children with acute and chronic illnesses using specialist home-based nursing services; however, the only summary finding across a few studies was that there is a significant decrease in length of hospitalisation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	The preliminary results show no adverse impact on physical health outcomes and a number of papers reported improved satisfaction with home-based care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004383.pub3	Further trials are required, measuring health, satisfaction, service utilisation and long-term costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	The 2016 update included two more studies (n = 196) and more publications with additional data for four already included studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	The updated review therefore includes 7524 participants from 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	We found data relevant to two comparisons: ICM versus standard care, and ICM versus non-ICM.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	The majority of studies had a high risk of selective reporting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	No studies provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	When ICM was compared with standard care for the outcome service use, ICM slightly reduced the number of days in hospital per month (n = 3595, 24 RCTs, MD -0.86, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.34,low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	Similarly, for the outcome global state, ICM reduced the number of people leaving the trial early (n = 1798, 13 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	For the outcome adverse events, the evidence showed that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1456, 9 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.51, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	In addition, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment due to very low-quality evidence (n = 1129, 4 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.0, very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	2. ICM versus non-ICM	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	When ICM was compared with non-ICM for the outcome service use, there was moderate-quality evidence that ICM probably makes little or no difference in the average number of days in hospital per month (n = 2220, 21 RCTs, MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.21, moderate-quality evidence) or in the average number of admissions (n = 678, 1 RCT, MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.05, moderate-quality evidence) compared to non-ICM.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	Similarly, the results showed that ICM may reduce the number of participants leaving the intervention early (n = 1970, 7 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95,low-quality evidence) and that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1152, 3 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.84, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	Finally, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment as compared to non-ICM (n = 73, 1 RCT, RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.74, very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	3. Fidelity to ACT Within the meta-regression we found that i.) the more ICM is adherent to the ACT model, the better it is at decreasing time in hospital ('organisation fidelity' variable coefficient -0.36, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.07); and ii.) the higher the baseline hospital use in the population, the better ICM is at decreasing time in hospital ('baseline hospital use' variable coefficient -0.20, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.10).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	Combining both these variables within the model, 'organisation fidelity' is no longer significant, but the 'baseline hospital use' result still significantly influences time in hospital (regression coefficient -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.07, P = 0.0027).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	Based on very low- to moderate-quality evidence, ICM is effective in ameliorating many outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	Compared to standard care, ICM may reduce hospitalisation and increase retention in care.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	It also globally improved social functioning, although ICM's effect on mental state and quality of life remains unclear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	Intensive Case Management is at least valuable to people with severe mental illnesses in the subgroup of those with a high level of hospitalisation (about four days per month in past two years).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	Intensive Case Management models with high fidelity to the original team organisation of ACT model were more effective at reducing time in hospital.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	However, it is unclear what overall gain ICM provides on top of a less formal non-ICM approach.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3	We do not think that more trials comparing current ICM with standard care or non-ICM are justified, however we currently know of no review comparing non-ICM with standard care, and this should be undertaken.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Twenty-five trials contributed data to the quantitative synthesis in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	All but one trial were at high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Overall, 16 trials (464 participants) provided data for meta-analysis of box training (248 participants) versus no supplementary training (216 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	All the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Overall, 14 trials (382 participants) provided data for quantitative comparison of different methods of box training.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	There were no trials comparing box model training versus animal model or cadaveric model training.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Box model training versus no training:	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	The meta-analysis showed that the time taken for task completion was significantly shorter in the box trainer group than the control group (8 trials; 249 participants; SMD -0.48 seconds; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.22).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Compared with the control group, the box trainer group also had lower error score (3 trials; 69 participants; SMD -0.69; 95% CI -1.21 to -0.17), better accuracy score (3 trials; 73 participants; SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.17), and better composite performance scores (SMD 0.65; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Three trials reported movement distance but could not be meta-analysed as they were not in a format for meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	There was significantly lower movement distance in the box model training compared with no training in one trial, and there were no significant differences in the movement distance between the two groups in the other two trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	None of the remaining secondary outcomes such as mortality and morbidity were reported in the trials when animal models were used for assessment of training, error in movements, and trainee satisfaction.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Different methods of box training: One trial (36 participants) found significantly shorter time taken to complete the task when box training was performed using a simple cardboard box trainer compared with the standard pelvic trainer (SMD -3.79 seconds; 95% CI -4.92 to -2.65).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	There was no significant difference in the time taken to complete the task in the remaining three comparisons (reverse alignment versus forward alignment box training; box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; and single incision versus multiport box model training).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	There were no significant differences in the error score between the two groups in any of the comparisons (box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; single incision versus multiport box model training; Z-maze box training versus U-maze box training).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	The only trial that reported accuracy score found significantly higher accuracy score with Z-maze box training than U-maze box training (1 trial; 16 participants; SMD 1.55; 95% CI 0.39 to 2.71).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	One trial (36 participants) found significantly higher composite score with simple cardboard box trainer compared with conventional pelvic trainer (SMD 0.87; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.56).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Another trial (22 participants) found significantly higher composite score with reverse alignment compared with forward alignment box training (SMD 1.82; 95% CI 0.79 to 2.84).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	There were no significant differences in the composite score between the intervention and control groups in any of the remaining comparisons.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	None of the secondary outcomes were adequately reported in the trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	The results of this review are threatened by both risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Laparoscopic box model training appears to improve technical skills compared with no training in trainees with no previous laparoscopic experience.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	The impacts of this decreased time on patients and healthcare funders in terms of improved outcomes or decreased costs are unknown.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	There appears to be no significant differences in the improvement of technical skills between different methods of box model training.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Further well-designed trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2	Such trials should assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills in both the short and long term, as well as clinical outcomes when the trainee becomes competent to operate on patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004036.pub3	Two randomised clinical trials were eligible for inclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004036.pub3	One trial compared biliary lavage with hydrocortisone versus saline in 17 patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004036.pub3	Hydrocortisone tended to increase adverse events (pancreatitis, cholangitis with septicaemia, paranoid ideas, fluid retention) (RR 3.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 22.9) and had no cholangiographic improvement, which led to termination of the trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004036.pub3	The other trial compared budesonide versus prednisone in 18 patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004036.pub3	Patients had statistically significant higher serum bilirubin concentration after treatment with prednisone compared with budesonide (MD 10.4 µmol/litre, 95% CI 1.16 to 19.64 µmol/litre).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004036.pub3	No other statistically significant effects on clinical or biochemical outcomes were reported on any of the evaluated interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004036.pub3	There is no evidence to support or refute peroral glucocorticosteroids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004036.pub3	The intrabiliary application of corticosteroids via nasobiliary tube seems to induce severe adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	A total of 11 trials were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	Seven trials addressed the timing of support (early versus delayed), data on mortality were obtained for all seven trials (284 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	The relative risk (RR) for death with early nutritional support was 0.67 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.07).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	Data on disability were available for three trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	The RR for death or disability at the end of follow-up was 0.75 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.11).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	Seven trials compared parenteral versus enteral nutrition.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	Because early support often involves parenteral nutrition, three of the trials are also included in the previous analyses.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	Five trials (207 participants) reported mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	The RR for mortality at the end of follow-up period was 0.66 (0.41 to 1.07).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	Two trials provided data on death and disability.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	The RR was 0.69 (95% Cl 0.40 to 1.19).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	One trial compared gastric versus jejunal enteral nutrition, there were no deaths and the RR was not estimable.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	This review suggests that early feeding may be associated with a trend towards better outcomes in terms of survival and disability.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	Further trials are required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001530.pub2	These trials should report not only nutritional outcomes but also the effect on death and disability.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -95.12, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95% CI -60.64 to -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention effectiveness.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011479.pub2	Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	We included 24 studies in the review with a total of 4233 participants, of which 2124 were randomised to benzodiazepines and 1475 to placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	The remaining 634 participants were randomised to other active treatments in three-arm trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	We rated all studies as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	In addition, we judged 20 of the 24 included studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one domain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	Two primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of benzodiazepines over placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	The estimated risk ratio (RR) for a response to treatment was 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 1.96) in favour of benzodiazepines, which corresponds to an estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	The dropout rate was lower among participants treated with benzodiazepines (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64); the estimated NNTB was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	We rated the quality of the evidence as low for both primary outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	The possible advantage of benzodiazepine was also seen for remission (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.88) and the endpoint data for social functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.42), both with low-quality evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	We assessed the evidence for the other secondary outcomes as of very low quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	With the exception of the analyses of the change score data for depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.04) and social functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.24), all secondary outcome analyses showed an effect in favour of benzodiazepines compared to placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	However, the number of dropouts due to adverse effects was higher with benzodiazepines than with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.15; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	Furthermore, our analyses of adverse events showed that a higher proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with benzodiazepines (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37; low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	Low-quality evidence shows a possible superiority of benzodiazepine over placebo in the short-term treatment of panic disorders.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	The validity of the included studies is questionable due to possible unmasking of allocated treatments, high dropout rates, and probable publication bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	Moreover, the included studies were only short-term studies and did not examine the long-term efficacy nor the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	Due to these limitations, our results regarding the efficacy of benzodiazepines versus placebo provide only limited guidance for clinical practice.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	Furthermore, the clinician's choice is not between benzodiazepines and placebo, but between benzodiazepines and other agents, notably SSRIs, both in terms of efficacy and adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010677.pub2	The choice of treatment should therefore be guided by the patient's preference and should balance benefits and harms from treatment in a long-term perspective.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	We identified 13 small trials (1520 participants randomised) and three ongoing trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias, and some studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	Duration and style of tai chi differed between trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	Seven studies recruited 903 healthy participants, the other studies recruited people with borderline hypertension or hypertension, elderly people at high risk of falling, and people with hypertension with liver and kidney yin deficiency syndrome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	No studies reported on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality or non-fatal events as most studies were short term (all studies had follow-up of one year or less).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	There was also considerable heterogeneity between studies, which meant that it was not possible to combine studies statistically for cardiovascular risk (I2 statistic for systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 96%, for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 96%, for total cholesterol 96%, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) 95%, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) 98%, triglycerides 75%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	Nine trials measured blood pressure, six individual trials found reductions in SBP (reductions ranged from -22.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -26.3 to -17.7) to -11.5 mmHg (95% CI -21.5 to -1.46)), two trials found no clear evidence of a difference (however, CIs were wide and an increase or decrease in SBP cannot be ruled out), and one trial found an increase in SBP with tai chi (increase 5.2 mmHg, 95% CI 3.73 to 6.67).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	A similar pattern was seen for DBP: three trials found a reduction in DBP (reductions ranged from -12.2 mmHg (95% CI -15.8 to -8.7) to -4.43 mmHg (95% CI -7.14 to -1.72)) and three trials found no clear evidence of a difference, however again with wide CIs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	Three trials reported lipid levels and two found reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides (total cholesterol reductions ranged from -1.30 mmol/L (95% CI -1.57 to -1.03) to -0.50 mmol/L (95% CI -0.74 to -0.26): LDL-C reductions ranged from -0.76 mmol/L (95% CI -0.93 to -0.59) to -0.59 mmol/L (95% CI -0.80 to -0.38): triglyceride reductions ranged from -0.46 mmol/L (95% CI -0.62 to -0.30) to -0.37 mmol/L (95% CI -0.67 to-0.07)) and increased HDL-C with the intervention (HDL-C increases ranged from 0.61 mmol/L (95% CI 0.51 to 0.71) to 0.16 mmol/L (95% CI 0.02 to 0.30)), while the third study found no clear evidence of a difference between groups on lipid levels.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	Quality of life was measured in one trial: tai chi improved quality of life at three months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	None of the included trials reported on adverse events, costs or occurrence of type 2 diabetes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	There are currently no long-term trials examining tai chi for the primary prevention of CVD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	Due to the limited evidence available currently no conclusions can be drawn as to the effectiveness of tai chi on CVD risk factors.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	There was some suggestion of beneficial effects of tai chi on CVD risk factors but this was not consistent across all studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies included in this review and studies were small and at some risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2	Results of the ongoing trials will add to the evidence base but additional longer-term, high-quality trials are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Twenty-seven RCTs were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	The interventions were very heterogeneous in the components of the family intervention, the other risk behaviours targeted alongside tobacco, the age of children at baseline and the length of follow-up.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Two interventions were tested by two RCTs, one was tested by three RCTs and the remaining 20 distinct interventions were tested only by one RCT.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Twenty-three interventions were tested in the USA, two in Europe, one in Australia and one in India.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	The control conditions fell into two main groups: no intervention or usual care; or school-based interventions provided to all participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	These two groups of studies were considered separately.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Most studies had a judgement of 'unclear' for at least one risk of bias criteria, so the quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Although there was heterogeneity between studies there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	We were unable to extract data from all studies in a format that allowed inclusion in a meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	There was moderate quality evidence family-based interventions had a positive impact on preventing smoking when compared to a no intervention control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Nine studies (4810 participants) reporting smoking uptake amongst baseline non-smokers could be pooled, but eight studies with about 5000 participants could not be pooled because of insufficient data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	The pooled estimate detected a significant reduction in smoking behaviour in the intervention arms (risk ratio [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 0.84).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Most of these studies used intensive interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Estimates for the medium and low intensity subgroups were similar but confidence intervals were wide.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Two studies in which some of the 4487 participants already had smoking experience at baseline did not detect evidence of effect (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.17).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Eight RCTs compared a combined family plus school intervention to a school intervention only.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Of the three studies with data, two RCTS with outcomes for 2301 baseline never smokers detected evidence of an effect (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96) and one study with data for 1096 participants not restricted to never users at baseline also detected a benefit (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	The other five studies with about 18,500 participants did not report data in a format allowing meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	One RCT also compared a family intervention to a school 'good behaviour' intervention and did not detect a difference between the two types of programme (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.38, n = 388).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	No studies identified any adverse effects of intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	There is moderate quality evidence to suggest that family-based interventions can have a positive effect on preventing children and adolescents from starting to smoke.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	There were more studies of high intensity programmes compared to a control group receiving no intervention, than there were for other compairsons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	The evidence is therefore strongest for high intensity programmes used independently of school interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Programmes typically addressed family functioning, and were introduced when children were between 11 and 14 years old.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Based on this moderate quality evidence a family intervention might reduce uptake or experimentation with smoking by between 16 and 32%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously because effect estimates could not include data from all studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective high intensity interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub3	This is different from authoritarian parenting (do as I say) or neglectful or unsupervised parenting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	Three studies met the inclusion criteria, enrolling 451 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	The trial size varied from 51 to 280 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	Two studies compared dexamethasone to placebo, and the third study compared a number of additional interventions in various combinations, including metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, tropisetron, and dexamethasone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	The duration of the studies ranged from seven to 14 days.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	We included two studies (127 participants) with data at eight days in the meta-analysis for nausea intensity; no data were available that incorporated the same outcome measures for the third study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	Corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone resulted in less nausea (measured on a scale of 0 to 10, with a lower score indicating less nausea) compared to placebo at eight days (MD 0.48 lower nausea, 95% CI 1.53 lower to 0.57 higher; very low-quality evidence), although this result was not statistically significant (P = 0.37).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	Frequency of adverse events was not significantly different between groups, and the interventions were well tolerated.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	Factors limiting statistical analysis included the lack of standardised measurements of nausea, and the use of different agents, dosages, and comparisons.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	Subgroup analysis according to type of cancer was not possible due to insufficient data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	The quality of this evidence was downgraded by three levels, from high to very low due to imprecision, likely selection bias, attrition bias, and the small number of participants in the included studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	There are few studies assessing the effects of corticosteroids on nausea and vomiting not related to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery in adult cancer patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	This review found very low-quality evidence which neither supported nor refuted corticosteroid use in this setting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012002.pub2	Further high quality studies are needed to determine if corticosteroids are efficacious in this setting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	We included 10 RCTs of high-risk children using antibiotics (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, isoniazid, oral penicillin V or vancomycin) to prevent LRTIs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	Three studies included HIV-infected children (n = 1345), four cystic fibrosis (n = 429) and one each sickle cell disease (n = 219), cancer (n = 160) and low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (n = 40).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	The study duration ranged from seven days to three years.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	The quality of the evidence from studies including children with HIV infection, cystic fibrosis or cancer was moderate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	Due to inadequate data, we were unable to rate the quality of the evidence for two studies: one in children with sickle cell disease (low risk of bias), and another in low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (high risk of bias).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	In HIV-infected children receiving continuous isoniazid prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 1.29, I2 statistic = 47%, P value = 0.21).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	There was no significant effect on mortality with co-trimoxazole or isoniazid prophylaxis (RR 0.82, 0.46 to 1.46, I2 statistic = 76%, P value = 0.58); however, analysis of one study that used co-trimoxazole showed a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85, P value = 0.001).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	There was a significant decrease in the rates of hospital admission per child-year of follow-up with co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in one study (P value = 0.01).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	There was no evidence of increased adverse events due to antibiotic prophylaxis (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.64, I2 statistic = 22%, P value = 0.28); however, there was scant reporting of antibiotic resistance - the one study that did assess this found no increase.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	In two studies of children with cystic fibrosis receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in Pseudomonas infections (RR 0.76, 0.44 to 1.31, I2 statistic = 0%, P value = 0.33).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	In two studies assessing the benefit of azithromycin prophylaxis, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.76, I2 statistic = 0%, P value < 0.0001).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	The effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on growth in children with cystic fibrosis was inconsistent across the studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	There was an increased risk of emergence of pathogenic strains with either azithromycin or ciprofloxacin prophylaxis in two studies reporting this outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	There was no significant difference in the quality of life (one study).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	In three studies, there was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events with prophylaxis with azithromycin (two studies) or ciprofloxacin (one study).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	There was no evidence of increased antibiotic resistance in two studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	In the one study of children with sickle cell disease, a significantly lesser proportion of children with pneumococcal septicaemia was reported with penicillin V prophylaxis (P value = 0.0025).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	In the one study of children with cancer there was a significant decrease in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47, P value < 0.01).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	There was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events with antibiotic prophylaxis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	In low birth weight children with underlying respiratory disorders, there was no significant difference in the proportion of children with pulmonary infection with vancomycin prophylaxis (P value = 0.18).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	No included studies reported time off school or carer time off work.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	There is inconclusive evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis in certain groups of high-risk children can reduce pneumonia, exacerbations, hospital admission and mortality in certain conditions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	However, limitations in the evidence base mean more clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing LRTIs in children at high risk should be conducted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011530.pub2	Specifically, clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing LRTIs in congenital heart disease, metabolic disease, endocrine and renal disorders, neurological disease or prematurity should be a priority.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	We included nine RCTs, randomising 519 participants, comparing different gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum: nitrous oxide (three trials), helium (five trials), or room air (one trial) was compared to carbon dioxide.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	Three trials randomised participants to nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum (100 participants) or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (96 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	None of the trials was at low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide on cardiopulmonary complications (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.43; two studies; 140 participants; very low quality of evidence), or surgical morbidity (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.71; two studies; 143 participants; very low quality of evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	There were no serious adverse events related to either nitrous oxide or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (three studies; 196 participants; very low quality of evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	We could not combine data from two trials (140 participants) which individually showed lower pain scores (a difference of about one visual analogue score on a scale of 1 to 10 with lower numbers indicating less pain) with nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum at various time points on the first postoperative day, and this was rated asvery low quality .	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	Four trials randomised participants to helium pneumoperitoneum (69 participants) or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (75 participants) and one trial involving 33 participants did not state the number of participants in each group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	None of the trials was at low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of helium or carbon dioxide on cardiopulmonary complications (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.12; three studies; 128 participants; very low quality of evidence) or pain scores (visual analogue score on a scale of 1 to 10 with lower numbers indicating less pain; MD 0.49 cm, 95% CI -0.28 to 1.26; two studies; 108 participants; very low quality of evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	There were three serious adverse events (subcutaneous emphysema) related to helium pneumoperitoneum (three studies; 128 participants; very low quality of evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	One trial randomised participants to room air pneumoperitoneum (70 participants) or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (76 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	The trial was at unclear risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	There were no cardiopulmonary complications or serious adverse events observed related to either room air or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (both outcomes very low quality of evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	The evidence of lower hospital costs and reduced pain during the first postoperative day with room air pneumoperitoneum compared with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (a difference of about one visual analogue score on a scale of 1 to 10 with lower numbers indicating less pain, was rated as very low quality of evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	The quality of the current evidence is very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	The effects of nitrous oxide and helium pneumoperitoneum compared with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum are uncertain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	Evidence from one trial of small sample size suggests that room air pneumoperitoneum may decrease hospital costs in people undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	The safety of nitrous oxide, helium, and room air pneumoperitoneum has yet to be established.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	Further trials on this topic are needed, and should compare various gases (i.e. nitrous oxide, helium, argon, nitrogen, and room air) with carbon dioxide under standard pressure pneumoperitoneum with cold gas insufflation for people with high anaesthetic risk.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3	Future trials should include outcomes such as complications, serious adverse events, quality of life, and pain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	Fourteen studies were included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	Only RCTs investigating dexamethasone were identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	Eight studies enrolling a total of 303 participants investigated the cumulative dosage administered; three studies contrasted a high versus a moderate and five studies a moderate versus a low cumulative dexamethasone dose.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	Analysis of the studies investigating a moderate dexamethasone dose versus a high-dosage regimen showed an increased risk of BPD (typical risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.22; typical risk difference (RD) 0.26, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.49; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4, 95% CI 1.9 to 23.3; I² = 0%, 2 studies, 55 infants) as well as an increased risk of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome (typical RR 8.33, 95% CI 1.63 to 42.48; RD 0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.46; NNTH 4, 95% CI 2.2 to 7.3; I² = 68%, 2 studies, 74 infants) when using a moderate cumulative-dosage regimen.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	The composite outcomes of death or BPD and death or abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome showed similar results although the former only reached borderline significance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	There were no differences in outcomes between a moderate- and a low-dosage regimen.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	Four other studies enrolling 762 infants investigated early initiation of dexamethasone therapy versus a moderately early or delayed initiation and showed no significant differences in the primary outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	The two RCTs investigating a continuous versus a pulse dexamethasone regimen showed an increased risk of the combined outcome death or BPD when using the pulse therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	Finally, two trials investigating a standard regimen versus a participant-individualized course of dexamethasone showed no difference in the primary outcome and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	The quality of evidence for all comparisons discussed above was assessed as low or very low, because the validity of all comparisons is hampered by small samples of randomized infants, heterogeneity in study population and design, non-protocolized use of ‘rescue’ corticosteroids and lack of long-term neurodevelopmental data in most studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	Despite the fact that some studies reported a modulating effect of treatment regimens in favor of higher-dosage regimens on the incidence of BPD and neurodevelopmental impairment, recommendations on the optimal type of corticosteroid, the optimal dosage, or the optimal timing of initiation for the prevention of BPD in preterm infants cannot be made based on current level of evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010941.pub2	A well-designed large RCT is urgently needed to establish the optimal systemic postnatal corticosteroid dosage regimen.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	No new studies were included in this update.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	Eight randomised controlled trials involving 996 people were selected for inclusion in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	Researchers compared several steroidal agents such as corticotrophin, cortisone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin versus aspirin, placebo or no treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	Six trials were conducted between 1950 and 1965; one was done in 1990 and the final study was published in 2001.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	Overall there were no observed significant differences in risk of cardiac disease at one year between corticosteroid-treated and aspirin-treated groups (six studies, 907 participants, risk ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.15).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	Similarly, use of prednisone (two studies, 212 participants, risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 2.45) compared with aspirin did not reduce the risk of heart disease after one year.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	Investigators in five studies did not report adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	The three studies reporting on adverse events reported substantial adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	However, all results should be interpreted with caution because of the age of the studies and the substantial risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	Little evidence of benefit was found when corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulins were used to reduce the risk of heart valve lesions in patients with acute rheumatic fever.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	The antiquity of most of the trials restricted adequate statistical analysis of the data and acceptable assessment of clinical outcomes by current standards.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	In addition, risk of bias was substantial, so results should be viewed with caution.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003176.pub3	New randomised controlled trials in patients with acute rheumatic fever are warranted to assess the effects of corticosteroids such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone and the effects of other new anti-inflammatory agents.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	We included six studies with a total of 12,294 participants from 79 communities.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	Two studies that assessed insecticide spray as a fly control measure found that trachoma is reduced by at least 55% to 61% with this measure compared to no intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	However, another study did not find insecticide spray to be effective in reducing trachoma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	One study found that another fly control measure, latrine provision, reduced trachoma by 29.5% compared to no intervention; this was, however, not statistically significantly different and findings have not been confirmed by a more recent study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	Another study revealed that health education reduced the incidence of trachoma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	These findings were not confirmed by a second study, however, which found that a modest health education programme with modest water supply did not reduce trachoma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	However, all the studies have some methodological concerns.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	There is some evidence from two trials that insecticides are effective in reducing trachoma, however, this effect was not demonstrated in another trial that used insecticides.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	Two trials on latrine provision as a fly control measure have not demonstrated significant trachoma reduction.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	Health education had shown significant reduction of trachoma in one study but another study did not demonstrate similar findings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004003.pub4	Generally there is a dearth of data to determine the effectiveness of all aspects of environmental sanitation in the control of trachoma.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001027.pub2	Fifteen studies (1043 CFS participants) were included in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001027.pub2	When comparing CBT with usual care (six studies, 373 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post-treatment was highly significant in favour of CBT (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.19), with 40% of CBT participants (four studies, 371 participants) showing clinical response in contrast with 26% in usual care (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.76).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001027.pub2	Findings at follow-up were inconsistent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001027.pub2	For CBT versus other psychological therapies, comprising relaxation, counselling and education/support (four studies, 313 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post-treatment favoured CBT (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.20).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001027.pub2	Findings at follow-up were heterogeneous and inconsistent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001027.pub2	Only two studies compared CBT against other interventions and one study compared CBT in combination with other interventions against usual care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001027.pub2	CBT is effective in reducing the symptoms of fatigue at post-treatment compared with usual care, and may be more effective in reducing fatigue symptoms compared with other psychological therapies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001027.pub2	The evidence base at follow-up is limited to a small group of studies with inconsistent findings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001027.pub2	There is a lack of evidence on the comparative effectiveness of CBT alone or in combination with other treatments, and further studies are required to inform the development of effective treatment programmes for people with CFS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	One double-blind randomised controlled study including 46 people with sickle cell disease (HbSS, HbSC, HbSβ+thal and HbSβ0thal) was eligible for inclusion in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Of the 46 enrolled participants, seven withdrew before randomisation leaving 39 participants who were randomised.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Only 25 participants completed the full six months of follow up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Participants were randomised to receive oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) (n = 20) or placebo (n = 19) for six weeks and were followed up to six months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Two participants from the treatment group have missing values of baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, therefore the number of samples analysed was 37 (vitamin D n = 18, placebo n = 19).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	The included study had a high risk of bias with regards to incomplete outcome data (high dropout rate in the placebo group), but a low risk of bias for other domains such as random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors, selective outcome reporting; and an unclear risk of other biases.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Compared to the placebo group, the vitamin D group had significantly higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels at eight weeks, mean difference 29.79 (95% confidence interval 26.63 to 32.95); at 16 weeks, mean difference 12.67 (95% confidence interval 10.43 to 14.90); and at 24 weeks, mean difference 15.52 (95% confidence interval 13.50 to 17.54).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	We determined the quality of the evidence for this outcome to be moderate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	There was no significant difference of adverse events (tingling of lips or hands) between the vitamin D and placebo groups, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval 0.14 to 72.84), but the quality of the evidence was low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Regarding the frequency of pain, the vitamin D group had significantly fewer pain days compared to the placebo group, mean difference -10.00 (95% confidence interval -16.47 to -3.53), but again the quality of the evidence was low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Furthermore, the review included physical functioning PedsQL scores which was reported as absolute change from baseline.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	The vitamin D group had a lower (worse) health-related quality of life score than the placebo group but this was not significant at eight weeks, mean difference -2.02 (95% confidence interval -6.34 to 2.30).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	However, the difference was significant at both 16 weeks, mean difference -12.56 (95% confidence interval -16.44 to -8.69) and 24 weeks, mean difference -12.59 (95% confidence interval -17.43 to -7.76).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	We determined the quality of evidence for this outcome to be low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	We included only one low-quality clinical study which had a high risk of bias with regards to incomplete outcome data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Therefore, we consider that the evidence is not of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should consider the relevant existing guidelines for vitamin D supplementation (e.g. the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines) and dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D (e.g. from the USA Institute of Medicine).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Evidence of vitamin D supplementation in sickle cell disease from high quality studies is needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub2	Well-designed, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of parallel design, are required to determine the effects and the safety of vitamin D supplementation in children and adults with sickle cell disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	This review includes only one RCT, funded by the Australian Research Council; the University of Sydney International Development Fund; Douglas and Lola Douglas Scholarship on Child and Adolescent Health; Nadia Verrall Memorial Scholarship; and a James Kentley Memorial Fellowship.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	This study recruited 26 children aged 4 to 12 years, with mild to moderate CAS of unknown cause, and compared two interventions: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3); and the Rapid Syllable Transitions Treatment (ReST).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	Children were allocated randomly to one of the two treatments.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	Treatments were delivered intensively in one-hour sessions, four days a week for three weeks, in a university clinic in Australia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	Speech pathology students delivered the treatments in the English language.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	Outcomes were assessed before therapy, immediately after therapy, at one month and four months post-therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	Our review looked at one-month post-therapy outcomes only.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	A number of cases in each cohort had recommenced usual treatment by their speech and language pathologist between one month and four months post-treatment (NDP-3: 9/13 participants; ReST: 9/13 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	Hence, maintenance of treatment effects to four months post-treatment could not be analysed without significant potential bias, and thus this time point was not included for further analysis in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	We judged all core outcome domains to be low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one level to moderate due to imprecision, given that only one RCT was identified.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	Both the NDP-3 and ReST therapies demonstrated improvement at one month post-treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	For three outcomes the effect was marginally greater for NDP-3 than ReST: accuracy of production on treated words (NDP-3 mean difference (MD) = 36.0, ReST MD = 33.9; absolute MD = 2.1 between groups); speech production consistency, measured by 25 real words repeated three times using the inconsistency subtest of the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) test (NDP-3 MD = 11.1, ReST MD = 10.9; absolute MD = 0.2 between groups); and accuracy of connected speech, assessed by imitated word accuracy in connected speech of at least three word combinations (NDP-3 MD = 14.3, ReST MD = 11.5; absolute MD = 2.8 between groups).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	ReST (MD = 18.3) demonstrated a marginally greater effect than NDP-3 (MD = 18.2) for accuracy of production on non-treated words at one month post-treatment (absolute MD = 0.1 between groups).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	The study did not assess the outcome of functional communication.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	There is limited evidence that, when delivered intensively, both NDP-3 and ReST may effect improvement in word accuracy in 4- to 12-year-old children with CAS, measured by the accuracy of production on treated and non-treated words, speech production consistency and the accuracy of connected speech.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	The study did not measure functional communication.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	No formal analyses were conducted to compare NDP-3 and ReST by the original study authors, hence one treatment cannot be reliably advocated over the other.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	We are also unable to say whether either treatment is better than no treatment or treatment as usual.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	No evidence currently exists to support the effectiveness of other treatments for children aged 4 to 12 years with idiopathic CAS without other comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	Further RCTs replicating this study would strengthen the evidence base.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006278.pub3	Similarly, further RCTs are needed of other interventions, in other age ranges and populations with CAS and with co-occurring disorders.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	Four trials that randomised a total of 268 participants met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	In all four studies antibiotic was administered orally.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	One study conducted in Brazil in both adults and children compared trimethoprim-sulfamexacocol over 20 months to no treatment and was judged to be at high risk of performance, detection, and attrition bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	The other three studies compared antibiotic treatment to placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	We judged these three studies to be at a mixture of low or unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	One study conducted in the US in adults studied pyrimethamine-trisulfapyrimidine for eight weeks; one study conducted in the UK in children and adults evaluated pyrimethamine for four weeks; and one study conducted in Brazil in adults investigated trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 12 months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	In the last study, all participants had active retinochoroiditis and were treated with antibiotics for 45 days prior to randomisation to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	Only the study in Brazil of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole over 12 months, in participants with healed lesions, reported the effect of treatment on visual acuity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	People treated with antibiotics may have a similar change in visual acuity compared with people treated with placebo at one year (mean difference -1.00 letters, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.93 to 5.93 letters; 93 participants; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	Treatment with antibiotics probably reduces the risk of recurrent retinochoroiditis compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.63; 227 participants; 3 studies; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence); similar results were seen for acute and chronic retinochoroiditis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	The UK study of pyrimethamine for four weeks reported an improvement in intraocular inflammation in treated compared with control participants (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.19; 29 participants; low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	The study in Brazil of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 12 months stated that the severity of inflammation was higher in the comparator group when compared to the antibiotic-treated group but did not provide further details.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	In the US study of pyrimethamine-trisulfapyrimidine for eight weeks intraocular inflammation had almost completely resolved by eight weeks in all participants, however in this study all participants received steroid treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	Two studies (UK and US studies) reported an increased risk of adverse events in treated participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	These were a fall in haemoglobin, leucocyte, and platelet count, nausea, loss of appetite, rash, and arthralgia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	Treatment with antibiotics probably reduces the risk of recurrent toxoplasma retinochoroiditis, but there is currently no good evidence that this leads to better visual outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	However, absence of evidence of effect is not the same as evidence of no effect.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2	Further trials of people with acute and chronic toxoplasma retinochoroiditis affecting any part of the retina are required to determine the effects of antibiotic treatment on visual outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	We included 43 trials containing predominantly older people with mainly trochanteric fractures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	Twenty-two trials (3749 participants) compared the Gamma nail with the sliding hip screw (SHS).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	The Gamma nail was associated with increased risk of operative and later fracture of the femur and increased reoperation rate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	There were no major differences between implants in wound infection, mortality or medical complications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	Five trials (623 participants) compared the intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) with the SHS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	Fracture fixation complications were more common in the IMHS group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	Results for post-operative complications, mortality and functional outcomes were similar in both groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	Three trials (394 participants) showed no difference in fracture fixation complications, reoperation, wound infection and length of hospital stay for proximal femoral nail (PFN) versus the SHS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	None of the 10 trials (1491 participants) of other nail versus extramedullary implant comparisons for trochanteric fractures provided sufficient evidence to establish definite differences between the implants under test.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	Two trials (65 participants) found intramedullary nails were associated with fewer fracture fixation complications than fixed nail plates for unstable fractures at the level of the lesser trochanter.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	Two trials (124 participants) found a tendency to less fracture healing complications with the intramedullary nails compared with fixed nail plates for subtrochanteric fractures.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	With its lower complication rate in comparison with intramedullary nails, and absence of functional outcome data to the contrary, the SHS appears superior for trochanteric fractures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	Further studies are required to confirm whether more recently developed designs of intramedullary nail avoid the complications of previous nails.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000093.pub5	Intramedullary nails may have advantages over fixed angle plates for subtrochanteric and some unstable trochanteric fractures, but further studies are required.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD007792.pub2	It analysed retrospective data for 47 women who received either palliative surgery (n = 27) or medical management with Octreotide (n = 20) and reported overall survival and perioperative mortality and morbidity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007792.pub2	Women with poor performance status were excluded from surgery.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007792.pub2	Although six (22%) women who received surgery had serious complications of the operation and three (11%) died of complications, multivariable analysis found that women who received surgery had significantly (p < 0.001) better survival than women who received Octreotide, after adjustment for important prognostic factors.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007792.pub2	However, the magnitude of this effect was not reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007792.pub2	Quality of life (QoL) was not reported and adverse events were incompletely documented.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007792.pub2	We found only low quality evidence comparing palliative surgery and medical management for bowel obstruction in ovarian cancer.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007792.pub2	Therefore we are unable to reach definite conclusions about the relative benefits and harms of the two forms of treatment, or to identify sub-groups of women who are likely to benefit from one treatment or the other.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007792.pub2	However, there is weak evidence in support of surgical management to prolong survival.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD008565.pub2	Although statins improve lipid profiles and reduce testosterone levels in women with PCOS, there is no evidence that statins improve resumption of menstrual regularity or spontaneous ovulation, nor is there any improvement of hirsutism or acne.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008565.pub2	There is a need for further research to be performed with large sample sizes and well-designed RCTs to assess clinical outcomes.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD011000.pub3	We identified only observational data from single-arm studies of women treated with formalin-soaked packs, interventional radiology or radiotherapy techniques for palliative control of vaginal bleeding in women with cervical cancer.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011000.pub3	Since the last version of this review we found no new studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011000.pub3	There is no evidence from controlled trials to support or refute the use of any of the proposed interventions compared with radiotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011000.pub3	Therefore, the choice of intervention will be based on local resources.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011000.pub3	Radiotherapy techniques for managing vaginal bleeding are not readily available in resource-poor settings, where advanced cases of cervical cancer are predominant.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011000.pub3	Thus, this systematic review identified the need for a randomised controlled trial assessing the benefits and risks of palliative treatments for vaginal bleeding in women with advanced cervical cancer.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	For primary therapy three RCTs were identified, enrolling a total of 745 patients, that investigated temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	Temozolomide increased OS (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.79, P value 0.0003) and increased PFS (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92, P value 0.02), when compared with radiotherapy alone, although these benefits only appear to emerge when therapy is given in both concomitant and adjuvant phases of treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	A single RCT found that temozolomide did not have a statistically significant effect on QoL.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	Risk of haematological complications, fatigue and infections were increased with temozolomide.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	In recurrent HGG, two RCTs enrolling 672 patients in total found that temozolomide did not increase OS compared to standard chemotherapy (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.06, P value 0.2) but it did increase PFS in a subgroup analysis of grade IV GBM tumours (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.90, P value 0.008).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	Adverse events were similar between arms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	In the elderly, 2 RCTs of 664 patients found OS and PFS was similar with temozolomide alone versus radiotherapy alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	QoL did not appear to differ between arms in a single trial but certain adverse events were significantly more common with temozolomide.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	Temozolomide when given in both concomitant and adjuvant phases is an effective primary therapy in GBM compared to radiotherapy alone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	It prolongs survival and delays progression without impacting on QoL but it does increase early adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	In recurrent GBM, temozolomide compared with standard chemotherapy improves time-to-progression (TTP) and may have benefits on QoL without increasing adverse events but it does not improve overall.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2	In the elderly, temozolomide alone appears comparable to radiotherapy in terms of OS and PFS but with a higher instance of adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009035.pub2	Two studies met our inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009035.pub2	The findings of one study conducted in Cambodia provide low quality evidence that private contracts with international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for district health systems management ('contracting-in') may improve health care access and utilization.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009035.pub2	Contracting-in increased use of antenatal care by 28% and use of public facilities by 14%.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009035.pub2	However, contracting-in was not found to have an effect on population health outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009035.pub2	The findings of the other study provide low quality evidence that intermittent training courses over 18 months may improve district health system managers’ performance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009035.pub2	In three countries in Latin America, managers who did not receive the intermittent training courses had between 2.4 and 8.3 times more management deficiencies than managers who received the training courses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009035.pub2	No studies that aimed to investigate interventions for retaining district health systems managers met our study selection criteria for inclusion in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009035.pub2	There is low quality evidence that contracting-in may improve health care accessibility and utilization and that intermittent training courses may improve district health systems managers’ performance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009035.pub2	More evidence is required before firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of these interventions in diverse settings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009035.pub2	Other interventions that might be promising candidates for hiring and retaining (e.g., government regulations, professional support programs) as well as training district health systems managers (e.g., in-service workshops with on-site support) have not been adequately investigated.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	We included three studies that involved 123 people.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	The methods used for blinding the participants and researchers to the treatment group were not reported, but as the comparison is surgical treatment with medical treatment this bias is hard to avoid.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	There was no description of concealment of the randomization sequence in two studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	All three studies reported on mortality, and deaths occurred in two studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	There was no clear evidence of a difference in mortality between treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 2.42); however, the analysis was underpowered to detect a difference between groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	Out of the 123 people randomized and treated, six people died; the causes of death were pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, mediastinitis, and septic shock.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	Among people randomized to surgery, there were reductions in pneumonia (RR 0.36, 95% 0.15 to 0.85; three studies, 123 participants), chest deformity (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.67; two studies, 86 participants), and tracheostomy (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.02; two studies, 83 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	Duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay (ICU), and length of hospital stay were measured in the three studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	Due to differences in reporting, we could not combine the results and have listed them separately.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	Chest pain, chest tightness, bodily pain, and adverse effects were each measured in one study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	There was some evidence from three small studies that showed surgical treatment was preferable to nonsurgical management in reducing pneumonia, chest deformity, tracheostomy, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of ICU stay.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009919.pub2	Further well-designed studies with a sufficient sample size are required to confirm these results and to detect possible surgical effects on mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	Fifty trials (19 RCTs and 31 before-and-after studies) evaluated the dose-related efficacy of cerivastatin in 12,877 participants who had their LDL cholesterol measured.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	The participants were of any age with and without cardiovascular disease and the trials studied cerivastatin effects within a treatment period of three to 12 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	Cerivastatin 0.025 mg/day to 0.8 mg/day caused LDL cholesterol decreases of 11.0% to 40.8%, total cholesterol decreases of 8.0% to 28.8% and triglyceride decreases of 9.0% to 21.4%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	We judged the certainty of evidence for these effects to be high.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	Log dose-response data over doses of 2.5 mg to 80 mg revealed strong linear dose-related effects on LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	When compared to fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, cerivastatin was about 250-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 20-fold more potent than atorvastatin and 5.5-fold more potent than rosuvastatin at reducing LDL cholesterol; 233-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 18-fold more potent than atorvastatin and six-fold more potent than rosuvastatin at reducing total cholesterol; and 125-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 11-fold more potent than atorvastatin and 13-fold more potent than rosuvastatin at reducing triglycerides.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	There was no dose-related effect of cerivastatin on HDL cholesterol, but overall cerivastatin increased HDL cholesterol by 5%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	There was a high risk of bias for the outcome withdrawals due to adverse effects, but a low risk of bias for the lipid measurements.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not different between cerivastatin and placebo in 11 of 19 of these short-term trials (risk ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.74).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	The LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride lowering effect of cerivastatin was linearly dependent on dose.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	Cerivastatin log dose-response data were linear over the commonly prescribed dose range.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	Based on an informal comparison with fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, cerivastatin was about 250-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 20-fold more potent than atorvastatin and 5.5-fold more potent than rosuvastatin in reducing LDL cholesterol, and 233-fold greater potency than fluvastatin, 18-fold greater potency than atorvastatin and six-fold greater potency than rosuvastatin at reducing total cholesterol.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012501.pub2	This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with cerivastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 42% of the RCTs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010777.pub2	We included 28 studies which randomised a total of 6851 patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010777.pub2	Risk of bias assessment indicated unclear to low risk of bias for most studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010777.pub2	For consistency regarding the direction of effects, continuous outcomes with negative values, and dichotomous outcomes with values less than one favour remote ischaemic preconditioning.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010777.pub2	Based on high quality evidence, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the reduction of serum creatinine levels at postoperative days one (14 studies, 1022 participants: MD -0.02 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.02; I2 = 21%), two (9 studies, 770 participants: MD -0.04 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.02; I2 = 31%), and three (6 studies, 417 participants: MD -0.05 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10; I2 = 68%) compared to control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010777.pub2	Serious adverse events occurred in four patients receiving remote ischaemic preconditioning by iliac clamping.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010777.pub2	It is uncertain whether remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation leads to increased adverse effects compared to control because the certainty of the evidence is low (15 studies, 3993 participants: RR 3.47, 95% CI 0.55 to 21.76; I2 = 0%); only two of 15 studies reported any adverse effects (6/1999 in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group and 1/1994 in the control group), the remaining 13 studies stated no adverse effects were observed in either group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010777.pub2	Compared to control, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the need for dialysis (13 studies, 2417 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.94; I2 = 60%; moderate quality evidence), length of hospital stay (8 studies, 920 participants: MD 0.17 days, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.80; I2 = 49%, high quality evidence), or all-cause mortality (24 studies, 4931 participants: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.37; I2 = 0%, high quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010777.pub2	Remote ischaemic preconditioning may have slightly improved the incidence of acute kidney injury using either the AKIN (8 studies, 2364 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; I2 = 61%, high quality evidence) or RIFLE criteria (3 studies, 1586 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; I2 = 0%, moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010777.pub2	Remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation appears to be a safe method, and probably leads to little or no difference in serum creatinine, adverse effects, need for dialysis, length of hospital stay, death and in the incidence of acute kidney injury.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010777.pub2	Overall we had moderate-high certainty evidence however the available data does not confirm the efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing renal ischaemia reperfusion injury in patients undergoing major cardiac and vascular surgery in which renal ischaemia reperfusion injury may occur.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3	We retrieved 12,490 citations, obtained full texts for 58 studies and included 12 trials (three from the 2008 search and nine from the 2014 search) with 703 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3	Eight trials primarily investigated the efficacy in treating PSF, of which six trials with seven comparisons provided data suitable for meta-analysis (five pharmacological interventions: fluoxetine, enerion, (-)-OSU6162, citicoline and a combination of Chinese herbs; and two non-pharmacological interventions: a fatigue education programme and a mindfulness-based stress reduction programme).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3	The fatigue severity was lower in the intervention groups than in the control groups (244 participants, pooled SMD -1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.93 to -0.21), with significant heterogeneity between trials (I2 = 87%, degrees of freedom (df) = 6, P value < 0.00001).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3	The beneficial effect was not seen in trials that had used adequate allocation concealment (two trials, 89 participants, SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.04) or trials that had used adequate blinding of outcome assessors (four trials, 198 participants, SMD -1.10, 95% CI -2.31 to 0.11).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3	No trial primarily investigated the efficacy in preventing PSF.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3	Four trials (248 participants) did not primarily investigate the efficacy on fatigue but other symptoms after stroke.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3	None of these interventions showed any benefit on reducing PSF, which included tirilazad mesylate, continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnoea, antidepressants and a self management programme for recovery from chronic diseases.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3	There was insufficient evidence on the efficacy of any intervention to treat or prevent fatigue after stroke.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3	Trials to date have been small and heterogeneous, and some have had a high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007030.pub3	Some of the interventions described were feasible in people with stroke, but their efficacy should be investigated in RCTs with a more robust study design and adequate sample sizes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	Three randomised trials, enrolling 74 preterm infants (outcome data available on 71 infants) evaluated interventions for hyperkalaemia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	Urine output was ascertained in only one study (Hu 1999).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	In none of the trials could we ascertain that allocation to the comparison groups was concealed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	The sample sizes of the three trials were very small with 12 (Malone 1991), 19 (Singh 2002) and 40 infants enrolled (Hu 1999).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	The intervention and the outcome assessments could not be blinded to the clinical staff in two trials (Malone 1991; Hu 1999).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	One study (Malone 1991), glucose and insulin, compared to cation-exchange resin, caused a reduction in all cause mortality that was of borderline statistical significance: RR 0.18 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.15); RD -0.66 (95% CI -1.09 to -0.22); NNTB 2 (95% CI 1 to 5)].	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	In the study of Hu (Hu 1999), the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage ≥ grade 2 was significantly reduced [RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.93); RD -0.35 (95% CI -0.62 to -0.08); NNTB 3 (95% CI 2 to 13).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	Albuterol inhalation versus saline inhalation changed serum K+ from baseline at four hours [WMD -0.69 mmol/L (95% CI -0.87 to -0.51)] and at eight hours [WMD -0.59 mmol/L (95% CI -0.78 to -0.40)] after initiation of treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	No differences noted in mortality or other clinical outcomes (Singh 2002).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	No serious side effects were noted with either the combination of insulin and glucose or albuterol inhalation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	Other interventions listed in our objectives have not been studied to date.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	In view of the limited information from small studies of uncertain quality, no firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	It appears that the combination of insulin and glucose is preferred over treatment with rectal cation-resin for hyperkalaemia in preterm infants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	Both the combination of insulin and glucose and albuterol inhalation deserve further study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	The two interventions could possibly be tested against each other.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005257.pub3	The effectiveness of other potentially effective interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia (diuretics, exchange transfusion, peritoneal dialysis and calcium) have not been tested in randomised controlled trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	Twelve trials were found to be eligible for inclusion in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	Seven trials with a variable risk of bias compared IVIg with PE in 623 severely affected participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	In five trials with 536 participants for whom the outcome was available, the mean difference (MD) of change in a seven-grade disability scale after four weeks was not significantly different between the two treatments: MD of 0.02 of a grade more improvement in the intravenous immunoglobulin than the plasma exchange group; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to -0.20.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	There were also no statistically significant differences in the other measures considered.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	Three studies including a total of 75 children suggested that IVIg significantly hastens recovery compared with supportive care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	The primary outcome for this review, available for only one trial with 21 mildly affected children, showed significantly more improvement in disability grade after four weeks with IVIg than supportive treatment alone, MD 1.42, 95% CI 2.57 to 0.27.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	In one trial involving 249 participants comparing PE followed by IVIg with PE alone, the mean grade improvement was 0.2 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.54) more in the combined treatment group than in the PE alone group; not clinically significantly different, but not excluding the possibility of significant extra benefit.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	Another trial with 34 participants comparing immunoabsorption followed by IVIg with immunoabsorption alone did not reveal significant extra benefit from the combined treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	Adverse events were not significantly more frequent with either treatment, but IVIg is significantly much more likely to be completed than PE.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	One trial in altogether 51 children showed no significant difference when the standard dose was given over two days rather than five days.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	A previous Cochrane review has shown that PE hastens recovery compared with supportive treatment alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	There are no adequate comparisons of IVIg with placebo in adults, but this review provides moderate quality evidence that, in severe disease, IVIg started within two weeks from onset hastens recovery as much as PE.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	Adverse events were not significantly more frequent with either treatment but IVIg is significantly much more likely to be completed than PE.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	Also, according to moderate quality evidence, giving IVIg after PE did not confer significant extra benefit.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	In children, according to low quality evidence, IVIg probably hastens recovery compared with supportive care alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	More research is needed in mild disease and in patients whose treatment starts more than two weeks after onset.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002063.pub6	Dose-ranging studies are also needed and one is in progress.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2	We included 28 randomized clinical trials (9330 participants); in the 21 trials reporting relevant outcomes for this review, 7597 participants were randomly assigned to a high fraction of inspired oxygen versus a routine fraction of inspired oxygen.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2	In trials with an overall low risk of bias, a high fraction of inspired oxygen compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all-cause mortality (random-effects model: RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.36; GRADE: low quality) within the longest follow-up and within 30 days of follow-up (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.60; GRADE: low quality).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2	In a trial sequential analysis, the required information size was not reached and the analysis could not refute a 20% increase in mortality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2	Similarly, when all trials were included, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all-cause mortality to the longest follow-up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33) or within 30 days of follow-up (Peto OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.29), both of very low quality according to GRADE.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2	Neither was a high fraction of inspired oxygen associated with the risk of surgical site infection in trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; GRADE: low quality) or in all trials (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07; GRADE: low quality).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2	A high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with respiratory insufficiency (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.99), serious adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43) or length of stay (mean difference -0.06 days, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.32 days).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2	In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was associated with a decrease in surgical site infections (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2	We did not observe an effect of a high fraction of inspired oxygen on surgical site infections in any other subgroup analyses.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2	As the risk of adverse events, including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher on surgical site infection, our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008884.pub2	Given the risk of attrition and outcome reporting bias, as well as other weaknesses in the available evidence, further randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias in all bias domains, including a large sample size and long-term follow-up, are warranted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	Twenty-five trials (3663 children) were eligible for inclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	Two trials did not report on any of the outcomes of interest, leaving 23 trials (3258 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time points for evaluation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	Overall, we assessed most studies as being at low to moderate risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	We found moderate quality evidence (six trials including 484 children) that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to have complete resolution at two to three months post-randomisation (primary outcome) than those allocated to the control treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58 to 2.53; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 5).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	However, there is evidence (albeit of low quality; five trials, 742 children) indicating that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash (primary outcome) than those allocated to control treatment (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.60; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 20).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	In respect of the secondary outcome of complete resolution at any time point, we found low to moderate quality evidence from five meta-analyses, including between two and 14 trials, of a beneficial effect of antibiotics, with a NNTB ranging from 3 to 7.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	Time periods ranged from 10 to 14 days to six months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	In terms of other secondary outcomes, only two trials (849 children) reported on hearing levels at two to four weeks and found conflicting results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	None of the trials reported data on speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	Low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with a decrease in the rate of ventilation tube insertion (two trials, 121 children) or in tympanic membrane sequelae (one trial, 103 children), while low quality evidence indicated that children treated with antibiotics were less likely to have acute otitis media episodes within four to eight weeks (five trials, 1086 children; NNTB 18) and within six months post-randomisation (two trials, 199 children; NNTB 5).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	It should, however, be noted that the beneficial effect of oral antibiotics on acute otitis media episodes within four to eight weeks was no longer significant when we excluded studies with high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	This review presents evidence of both benefits and harms associated with the use of oral antibiotics to treat children up to 16 years with OME.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	Although evidence indicates that oral antibiotics are associated with an increased chance of complete resolution of OME at various time points, we also found evidence that these children are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	The impact of antibiotics on short-term hearing is uncertain and low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with fewer ventilation tube insertions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	Furthermore, we found no data on the impact of antibiotics on other important outcomes such as speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	Even in situations where clear and relevant benefits of oral antibiotics have been demonstrated, these must always be carefully balanced against adverse effects and the emergence of bacterial resistance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub3	This has specifically been linked to the widespread use of antibiotics for common conditions such as otitis media.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	Twelve studies were included, nine RCTs and three before and after studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	Only one study explored all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as endpoints.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	The relative risk (RR) of ESRD or death was 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.72) for patients assigned to a low protein diet (LPD).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	Pooling of the seven RCTs in patients with type 1 diabetes resulted in a non-significant reduction in the decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 0.1 ml/min/month (95% CI -0.1 to 0.3) in the LPD group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	For type 2 diabetes, one trial showed a small insignificant improvement in the rate of decline of GFR in the protein-restricted group and a second found a similar decline in both the intervention and control groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	Actual protein intake in the intervention groups ranged from 0.7 to 1.1 g/kg/day.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	One study noted malnutrition in the LPD group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	We found no data on the effects of LPDs on health-related quality of life and costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	The results show that reducing protein intake appears to slightly slow progression to renal failure but not statistically significantly so.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	However, questions concerning the level of protein intake and compliance remain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	Further longer-term research on large representative groups of patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus is necessary.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	Because of the variability amongst patients, there might perhaps be a six month therapeutic trial of protein restriction in all individuals, with continuation only in those who responded best.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2	Trials are required of different types of protein.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	We identified a total of 19 studies involving 3480 people.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	Twelve studies were of good methodological quality and seven were of lower quality, according to the van Tulder scoring system.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	Within the subgroup of predominantly mild brain injury, 'strong evidence' suggested that most individuals made a good recovery when appropriate information was provided, without the need for additional specific interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	For moderate to severe injury, 'strong evidence' showed benefit from formal intervention, and 'limited evidence' indicated that commencing rehabilitation early after injury results in better outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	For participants with moderate to severe ABI already in rehabilitation, 'strong evidence' revealed that more intensive programmes are associated with earlier functional gains, and 'moderate evidence' suggested that continued outpatient therapy could help to sustain gains made in early post-acute rehabilitation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	The context of multi-disciplinary rehabilitation appears to influence outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	'Strong evidence' supports the use of a milieu-oriented model for patients with severe brain injury, in which comprehensive cognitive rehabilitation takes place in a therapeutic environment and involves a peer group of patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	'Limited evidence' shows that specialist in-patient rehabilitation and specialist multi-disciplinary community rehabilitation may provide additional functional gains, but studies serve to highlight the particular practical and ethical restraints imposed on randomisation of severely affected individuals for whom no realistic alternatives to specialist intervention are available.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	Problems following ABI vary.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	Consequently, different interventions and combinations of interventions are required to meet the needs of patients with different problems.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	Patients who present acutely to hospital with mild brain injury benefit from follow-up and appropriate information and advice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	Those with moderate to severe brain injury benefit from routine follow-up so their needs for rehabilitation can be assessed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	Intensive intervention appears to lead to earlier gains, and earlier intervention whilst still in emergency and acute care has been supported by limited evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	The balance between intensity and cost-effectiveness has yet to be determined.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	Patients discharged from in-patient rehabilitation benefit from access to out-patient or community-based services appropriate to their needs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	Group-based rehabilitation in a therapeutic milieu (where patients undergo neuropsychological rehabilitation in a therapeutic environment with a peer group of individuals facing similar challenges) represents an effective approach for patients requiring neuropsychological rehabilitation following severe brain injury.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	Not all questions in rehabilitation can be addressed by randomised controlled trials or other experimental approaches.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	For example, trial-based literature does not tell us which treatments work best for which patients over the long term, and which models of service represent value for money in the context of life-long care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004170.pub3	In the future, such questions will need to be considered alongside practice-based evidence gathered from large systematic longitudinal cohort studies conducted in the context of routine clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	We included one trial (involving 176 women) in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	This trial included four groups with a factorial design.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	The factorial design took into account two factors, i.e. infant location in relation to the mother and the type of infant apparel.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	We combined three of the groups as the intervention (rooming-in) group and the fourth group acted as the control (separate care) and we analysed the results as a single pair-wise comparison.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	Primary outcomes	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	The primary outcome, duration of any breastfeeding, was reported by authors as median values because the distribution was found to be skewed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	They reported the overall median duration of any breastfeeding to be four months, with no difference found between groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	Duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the proportion of infants being exclusively breastfed at six months of age was not reported in the trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	There was no difference found between the two groups in the proportion of infants receiving any breastfeeding at six months of age (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.39; one trial; 137 women; low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	Secondary outcomes	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	The mean frequency of breastfeeds per day on day four postpartum for the rooming-in group was 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 2.2), slightly higher than the separate care group, i.e. seven times per day.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	However, between-group comparison of this outcome was not appropriate since every infant in the separate care group was breastfed at a fixed schedule of seven times per day (SD = 0) resulting in no estimable comparison.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	The rate of exclusive breastfeeding on day four postpartum before discharge from hospital was significantly higher in the rooming-in group 86% (99 of 115) compared with separate care group, 45% (17 of 38), (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.76; one trial, 153 women; low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	None of our other pre-specified secondary outcomes were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	We found little evidence to support or refute the practice of rooming-in versus mother-infant separation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006641.pub3	Further well-designed RCTs to investigate full mother-infant rooming-in versus partial rooming-in or separate care including all important outcomes are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	Eight trials involving 660 participants were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	Seven of the eight studies were of poor quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	Follow-up time was less than one month in six trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	Only two trials provided data for the number of participants who were dead or dependent at the end of 28 days of treatment, indicating a significantly lower rate of death and dependency in the sanchi group than in the control group (relative risk (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.45 to 0.88).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	One trial reported higher Barthel index scores in the sanchi group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	Pooled analysis of seven trials indicated that sanchi might improve neurological deficit more than control with a significant difference (RR 0.29, 95%Cl 0.18 to 0.47).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	The total case fatality rate was lower than 1% indicating that participants probably had mild strokes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	Few adverse events were reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	Data were limited in respect of stroke recurrence and quality of life.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	Sanchi appears to be beneficial and safe for acute ischaemic stroke in this review, but the small sample and inferior quality of studies prevented a definite conclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006305.pub2	More well-designed randomised controlled trials are required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	Fourteen eligible RCTs were identified but only seven trials could be included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	Four RCTs evaluated implant placement timing.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	Two RCTs compared immediate versus delayed implants in 126 patients and found no statistically significant differences.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	One RCT compared immediate-delayed versus delayed implants in 46 patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	After 2 years patients in the immediate-delayed group perceived the time to functional loading significantly shorter, were more satisfied and independent blinded assessor judged the level of the perimplant marginal mucosa in relation to that of the adjacent teeth as more appropriate (RR = 1.68; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.72).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	These differences disappeared 5 years after loading but significantly more complications occurred in the immediate-delayed group (RR = 4.20; 95% CI 1.01 to 17.43).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	One RCT compared immediate with immediately delayed implants in 16 patients for 2 years and found no differences.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	Three RCTs evaluated different techniques of bone grafting for implants immediately placed in extraction sockets.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	No statistically significant difference was observed when evaluating whether autogenous bone is needed in postextractive sites (1 trial with 26 patients) or which was the most effective augmentation technique (2 trials with 56 patients).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	There is insufficient evidence to determine possible advantages or disadvantages of immediate, immediate-delayed or delayed implants, therefore these preliminary conclusions are based on few underpowered trials often judged to be at high risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	There is a suggestion that immediate and immediate-delayed implants may be at higher risks of implant failures and complications than delayed implants on the other hand the aesthetic outcome might be better when placing implants just after teeth extraction.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005968.pub3	There is not enough reliable evidence supporting or refuting the need for augmentation procedures at immediate implants placed in fresh extraction sockets or whether any of the augmentation techniques is superior to the others.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	Two MPAC trials were identified.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	One trial compared clioquinol (PBT1) with placebo in 36 patients and 32 had sufficient data for per protocol analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	There was no statistically significant difference in cognition (as measured on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition (ADAS-Cog)) between the active treatment and placebo groups at 36 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	The difference in mean change from baseline ADAS-Cog score in the clioquinol arm compared with the placebo arm at weeks 24 and 36 was a difference of 7.37 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 13.24) and 6.36 (95% CI -0.50 to 13.23), respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	There was no significant impact on non-cognitive symptoms or clinical global impression.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	One participant in the active treatment group developed neurological symptoms (impaired visual acuity and colour vision) which resolved on cessation of treatment and were possibly attributable to the drug.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	In the second trial a successor compound, PBT2, was compared with placebo in 78 participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia; all were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	There was no significant difference in the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) composite or memory between placebo and PBT2 in the least squares mean change from baseline at week 12.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	However, two executive function component tests of the NTB showed significant improvement over placebo in the PBT2 250 mg group from baseline to week 12: category fluency test (2.8 words, 95% CI 0.1 to 5.4; P = 0.041) and trail making part B (-48.0 s, 95% CI -83.0 to -13.0; P = 0.009).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	In the executive factor Z score, the difference in least squares mean change from baseline at week 12 for PBT2 250 mg compared with placebo was 0·27 (0·01 to 0·53; p=0·042).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	There was no significant effect on cognition on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or ADAS-Cog scales.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	PBT2 had a favourable safety profile.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	There is an absence of evidence as to whether clioquinol (PBT1) has any positive clinical benefit for patients with AD, or whether the drug is safe.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	We have some concerns about the quality of the study methodology; there was an imbalance in treatment and control groups after randomisation (participants in the active treatment group had a higher mean pre-morbid IQ) and the secondary analyses of results stratified by baseline dementia severity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	The planned phase III trial of PBT1 has been abandoned and this compound has been withdrawn from development.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	The second trial of PBT2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5	Larger trials are now required to demonstrate cognitive efficacy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012621.pub2	We included 36 studies with 2999 participants (with pulmonary hypertension from all causes) in the final review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012621.pub2	Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with some as long as 12 months.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD012621.pub2	Sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil are all efficacious in this clinical setting, and clinicians should consider the side-effect profile for each individual when choosing which PDE5 inhibitor to prescribe.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012621.pub2	While there appears to be some benefit for the use of PDE5 inhibitors in PH-left-heart disease, it is not clear based on the mostly small, short-term studies, which type of left-heart disease stands to benefit.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD012621.pub2	Further research is required into the mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension secondary to left-heart disease, and cautious consideration of which subset of these patients may benefit from PDE5 inhibitors.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012621.pub2	Future trials in PH-LHD should be sufficiently powered, with long-term follow-up, and should include invasive haemodynamic data, WHO functional class, six-minute walk distance, and clinical worsening.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	We included one new trial involving 45 participants in this updated review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	In total we included 22 trials involving a total of 2193 participants who received regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm or elbow surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	'Risk of bias' assessment indicated that trial design and conduct were generally adequate; the most common areas of weakness were in blinding and allocation concealment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	Nine trials comparing double versus single injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.89, high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	Subgroup analysis by method of nerve location showed that the effect size was greater when neurostimulation was used rather than the transarterial technique.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	Nine trials comparing multiple with single injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.42, high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	Pooled data from five trials also showed a significant decrease in incomplete motor block (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.96, high-quality evidence) in the multiple-injection group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	Twelve trials comparing multiple versus double injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.39, high-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	Pooled data from six trials also showed a significant decrease in incomplete motor block (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.85, high-quality evidence) in the multiple injection group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	Tourniquet pain was significantly reduced with multiple injections compared with double injections (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84, high-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	Otherwise there were no statistically significant differences between groups in any of the three comparisons on secondary analgesia failure, complications and patient discomfort.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	Compared with multiple injections, the time for block performance was significantly shorter for single injection (MD 3.33 minutes, 95% CI 2.76 to 3.90) and double injections (MD 1.54 minutes, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.29); however there was no difference in time to readiness for surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	This review provides evidence that multiple-injection techniques using nerve stimulation for axillary plexus block produce more effective anaesthesia than either double or single-injection techniques.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003842.pub5	However, there was insufficient evidence to draw any definitive conclusions regarding differences in other outcomes, including safety.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD001282	Study duration was 7-12 months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001282	In all three studies, a significant decrease in linear growth occurred in children treated with beclomethasone compared to those receiving placebo or non-steroidal asthma therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001282	The average decrease, calculated through meta-analysis, was -1.54 cm per year (95% CI -1.15, -1.94).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001282	In children with mild-moderate asthma, beclomethasone 200 mcg twice daily caused a decrease in linear growth of -1.54 cm per year.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001282	These studies lasted a maximum of 54 weeks, so it remains unclear whether the decrease in growth is sustained or whether it reverses with 'catch up' after therapy is discontinued.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001282	We are unable to comment on growth effects of other inhaled steroids that have potentially less systemic effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001282	If inhaled steroids are required to control a child's asthma, we recommend using the minimum dose that effectively controls the child's asthma and closely following growth.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006515	Three trials (139 patients) were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006515	APD did not differ from CAPD with respect to mortality (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.37), risk of peritonitis (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.11), switching from original PD modality to a different dialysis modality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.02), hernias (RR 1.26, 95% interval 0.32 to 5.01), PD fluid leaks (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.83), PD catheter removal (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48) or hospital admissions (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.17).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006515	There was no difference between either PD modality with respect to residual renal function (MD -0.17, 95% CI -1.66 to 1.32).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006515	One study found that peritonitis rates and hospitalisation were significantly less in patients on APD when results were expressed as episodes/patient-year.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006515	Another study found that patients on APD had significantly more time for work, family and social activities.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006515	APD has not been shown to have significant advantages over CAPD in terms of important clinical outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006515	APD may however be considered advantageous in select group of patients such as in the younger PD population and those in employment or education due to its psychosocial advantages.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006515	There is a need for a RCT comparing CAPD with APD with sufficiently large patient numbers looking at important clinical outcomes including residual renal function, accompanied by an economic evaluation to clarify the relative clinical and cost-effectiveness of both modalities.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	37 trials (9312 patients) were analysed: 15 (3343) for RT vs. CRT, 16 (2861) for CT vs. CRT, 3 (415) for RT vs. CT and 10 (3221) for IF-RT vs. EF-RT.  CRT was superior to RT in terms of OS (OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.89, P = 0.0004), PFS (OR=0.49, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.56, P < 0.0001) and SM (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.98, P = 0.03).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	The superiority of CRT also applied to early and advanced stages (mainly IIIA) separately.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	Excess SM with RT is due mainly to ST and is apparently caused by greater need for salvage therapy after RT.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	CRT was superior to CT in terms of PFS (OR = 77, 95 % CI 0.68 to 0.77, P < 0.0001).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	OS was better with CRT for early stages only (OR=0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.88, P = 0.006).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	SM risk was higher with CRT (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.89, P = 0.05), although not significant for early stages alone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	This effect, also seen in AL and ST separately, was due directly to first-line treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	Data were insufficient to compare RT to CT.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	EF-RT was superior to IF-RT (each additional to CT in most trials) in terms of PFS (OR=81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95, P = 0.009) but not OS.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	No significant difference in SM was observed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	CRT seems to be optimal for most early stage (I-II) HD patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	For advanced stages (III to IV), CRT better prevents progression/relapse but CT alone seems to cause less SM.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	RT alone gives a higher overall SM risk than CRT due to increased need for salvage therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	Reduced SM risk after IF-RT instead of EF-RT could not be demonstrated.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003187.pub2	Due to the large number of studies excluded because no IPD were received, to the inclusion of many outdated treatments and to the limited amount of long-term data, one must be cautious in applying these results to current therapies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2	We reviewed 26 studies with 27 treatment groups that enrolled a total of 4893 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2	Twenty five of the studies were case series or uncontrolled long-term trial continuations, the other was an RCT comparing two opioids.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2	Opioids were administered orally (number of study treatments groups [abbreviated as "k"] = 12, n = 3040), transdermally (k = 5, n = 1628), or intrathecally (k = 10, n = 231).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2	Many participants discontinued due to adverse effects (oral: 22.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.3% to 32.8%]; transdermal: 12.1% [95% CI: 4.9% to 27.0%]; intrathecal: 8.9% [95% CI: 4.0% to 26.1%]); or insufficient pain relief (oral: 10.3% [95% CI: 7.6% to 13.9%]; intrathecal: 7.6% [95% CI: 3.7% to 14.8%]; transdermal: 5.8% [95% CI: 4.2% to 7.9%]).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2	Signs of opioid addiction were reported in 0.27% of participants in the studies that reported that outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2	All three modes of administration were associated with clinically significant reductions in pain, but the amount of pain relief varied among studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2	Findings regarding quality of life and functional status were inconclusive due to an insufficient quantity of evidence for oral administration studies and inconclusive statistical findings for transdermal and intrathecal administration studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2	Many patients discontinue long-term opioid therapy (especially oral opioids) due to adverse events or insufficient pain relief; however, weak evidence suggests that patients who are able to continue opioids long-term experience clinically significant pain relief.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2	Whether quality of life or functioning improves is inconclusive.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2	Many minor adverse events (like nausea and headache) occurred, but serious adverse events, including iatrogenic opioid addiction, were rare.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	The review contains only one trial with a total of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage III and IV.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	The participants were mainly male (98.2%, 106/108) with a mean age of 58.4 (standard deviation 10.4) years in the oxandrolone group and were all male (100%, 104/104) with a mean age of 57.3 (standard deviation 11.6) years in the placebo group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	This trial compared oxandrolone (20 mg/day, administered orally) with a dose of placebo (an inactive substance consisting of 98% starch and 2% magnesium stearate) and reported data on complete healing of ulcers and adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	There was very low-certainty evidence on the relative effect of oxandrolone on complete ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period (risk ratio RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.26) (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% CI, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	Thus, we are uncertain whether oxandrolone improves or reduces the complete healing of pressure ulcers, as we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	There was low-certainty evidence on the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo (RR 3.85, 95% CI 1.12 to 13.26) (downgraded once for imprecision and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	Thus, the treatment with oxandrolone may increase the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	There was very low-certainty evidence on the risk of serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.17) (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% CI, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	Of the five serious adverse events reported in the oxandrolone-treated group, none were classed by the trial teams as being related to treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	We are uncertain whether oxandrolone increases or decreases the risk of serious adverse events as we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	Secondary outcomes such as pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment and quality of life were not reported in the included trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	Overall the evidence in this study was of very low quality (downgraded for imprecision and indirectness).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	This trial stopped early when the futility analysis (interim analysis) in the opinion of the study authors showed that oxandrolone had no benefit over placebo for improving ulcer healing.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	There is no high quality evidence to support the use of anabolic steroids in treating pressure ulcers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2	Further well-designed, multicenter trials, at low risk of bias, are necessary to assess the effect of anabolic steroids on treating pressure ulcers, but careful consideration of the current trial and its early termination are required when planning future research.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	We included six randomised controlled trials involving 8372 people.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	All trials were judged to be at high risk of bias for at least one domain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	Four trials compared email communication to standard mail and two compared email communication to usual care.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	For the primary health service outcome of uptake of preventive screening, there was no difference between email and standard mail (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.24).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	For both comparisons (email versus standard mail and email versus usual care) there was no difference between the groups for patient or caregiver understanding and support.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	Results were inconclusive for patient or caregiver behaviours and actions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	For email versus usual care only, there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of patient health status and well-being.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	No data were reported relating to healthcare professionals or harms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	The evidence on the use of email for the provision of information on disease prevention and health promotion was weak, and therefore inadequate to inform clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	The available trials mostly provide inconclusive, or no evidence for the outcomes of interest in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007982.pub2	Future research needs to use high-quality study designs that take advantage of the most recent developments in information technology, with consideration of the complexity of email as an intervention.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	A total of nine studies used post-Epley postural restrictions as their modification of the Epley manoeuvre.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	There was no evidence of a difference in the results for post-treatment vertigo intensity or subjective assessment of improvement in individual or pooled data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	All nine trials included the conversion of a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	Pooled data identified a significant difference from the addition of postural restrictions in the frequency of Dix-Hallpike conversion when compared to the Epley manoeuvre alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	In the experimental group 88.7% (220 out of 248) patients versus 78.2% (219 out of 280) in the control group converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.22, P = 0.002).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	No serious adverse effects were reported, however three studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV, dizziness and disequilibrium in some patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	There was no evidence of benefit of mastoid oscillation applied during the Epley manoeuvre, or of additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	No adverse effects were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	There is evidence supporting a statistically significant effect of post-Epley postural restrictions in comparison to the Epley manoeuvre alone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	However, it important to note that this statistically significant effect only highlights a small improvement in treatment efficacy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	An Epley manoeuvre alone is effective in just under 80% of patients with typical BPPV.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	The additional intervention of postural restrictions has a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	The addition of postural restrictions does not expose the majority of patients to risk of harm, does not pose a major inconvenience, and can be routinely discussed and advised.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	Specific patients who experience discomfort due to wearing a cervical collar and inconvenience in sleeping upright may be treated with the Epley manoeuvre alone and still expect to be cured in most instances.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine application of mastoid oscillation during the Epley manoeuvre, or additional steps in an 'augmented' Epley manoeuvre.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	Neither treatment is associated with adverse outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2	Further studies should employ a rigorous randomisation technique, blinded outcome assessment, a post-treatment Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure and longer-term follow-up of patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	Four studies (231 participants randomised) are included in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	No studies were at low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	The studies compared different types of surgery versus various types and doses of systemic and topical steroids and antibiotics.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	There were three comparison pairs: (1) endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) versus systemic steroids (one study, n = 109), (2) polypectomy versus systemic steroids (two studies, n = 87); (3) ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid (one study, n = 35).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	All participants also received topical steroids but doses and types were the same between the treatment arms of each study, except for the study using antibiotics.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	In that study, the medical treatment arm had higher doses than the surgical arm.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	In two of the studies, the authors failed to report the outcomes of interest.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	Although there were important differences in the types of treatments and comparisons used in these studies, the results were similar.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	Primary outcomes: symptom scores and quality of life scores	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	There were no important differences between groups in either the patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores or the health-related quality of life scores.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	Two studies (one comparing ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid, the other ESS versus systemic steroids) failed to find a difference in generic health-related quality of life scores.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	The quality of this evidence is low or very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	Endoscopic scores and other secondary outcomes	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	Two studies reported endoscopic scores.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	One study (ESS versus systemic steroids) reported a large, significant effect size in the surgical group, with a mean difference (MD) in score of -1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to -1.22, n = 95) on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no polyposis, 3 = severe polyposis).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	In the other study (ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid) no difference was found between the groups (MD 2.3%, 95% CI -17.4% to 12.8%, n = 34).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	None of the included studies reported recurrence rates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	No differences were found for any objective measurements or olfactory tests in those studies in which they were measured.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	Complications	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	Complication rates were not reported in all studies, but rates of up to 21% for medical treatment and 14.3% for surgical treatment are described.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	Epistaxis was the most commonly reported complication with both medical and surgical treatments, with severe complications reported rarely.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	The evidence relating to the effectiveness of different types of surgery versus medical treatment for adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is of very low quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	The evidence does not show that one treatment is better than another in terms of patient-reported symptom scores and quality of life measurements.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	The one positive finding from amongst the several studies examining a number of different comparisons must be treated with appropriate caution, in particular when the clinical significance of the measure is uncertain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006991.pub2	As the overall evidence is of very low quality (serious methodological limitations, reporting bias, indirectness and imprecision) and insufficient to draw firm conclusions, further research to investigate this problem, which has significant implications for quality of life and healthcare service usage, is justified.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	We included eight trials (709 participants); seven were from middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America where zinc deficiency is likely to be a public health problem.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	Four trials compared the effect of zinc-fortified staple foods with unfortified foods (comparison 1), and four compared zinc-fortified staple foods in combination with other nutrients/factors with the same foods containing other nutrients or factors without zinc (comparison 2).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	The interventions lasted between one and nine months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	We categorised most trials as having unclear or high risk of bias for randomisation, but low risk of bias for blinding and attrition.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	None of the studies in comparison 1 reported data on zinc deficiency.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	Foods fortified with zinc increased the serum or plasma zinc levels in comparison to foods without added zinc (mean difference (MD) 2.12 µmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 3.00 µmol/L; 3 studies; 158 participants; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	Participants consuming foods fortified with zinc versus participants consuming the same food without zinc had similar risk of underweight (average risk ratio 3.10, 95% CI 0.52 to 18.38; 2 studies; 397 participants; low-quality evidence) and stunting (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.13; 2 studies; 397 participants; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	A single trial of addition of zinc to iron in wheat flour did not find a reduction in proportion of zinc deficiency (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.94; very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	We did not find a difference in serum or plasma zinc levels in participants consuming foods fortified with zinc plus other micronutrients when compared with participants consuming the same foods with micronutrients but no added zinc (MD 0.03 µmol/L, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.72 µmol/L; 4 studies; 250 participants; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	No trial in comparison 2 provided information about underweight or stunting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	There was no reported adverse effect of fortification of foods with zinc on indicators of iron or copper status.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	Fortification of foods with zinc may improve the serum zinc status of populations if zinc is the only micronutrient used for fortification.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	If zinc is added to food in combination with other micronutrients, it may make little or no difference to the serum zinc status.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	Effects of fortification of foods with zinc on other outcomes including zinc deficiency, children’s growth, cognition, work capacity of adults, or on haematological indicators are unknown.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2	Given the small number of trials and participants in each trial, further investigation of these outcomes is required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	Eleven studies involving 3060 randomly assigned participants were included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	The quality of evidence is hampered by risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens decreased overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.48, six studies, 2712 participants) and increased clinical progression (one year: risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45, five studies, 2067 participants; 70 weeks: RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45, six studies, 2373 participants; two years: RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.25, three studies, 1336 participants), as well as treatment failure (one year: RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.38, four studies, 1539 participants; 70 weeks: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.52, five studies, 1845 participants; two years: RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.24, two studies, 808 participants), compared with medical or surgical castration.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	The quality of evidence for overall survival, clinical progression and treatment failure was rated as moderate according to GRADE.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	Predefined subgroup analyses showed that use of non-steroidal antiandrogens, compared with castration, was less favourable for overall survival, clinical progression (at one year, 70 weeks, two years) and treatment failure (at one year, 70 weeks, two years) in men with metastatic disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens also increased the risk for treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.94, eight studies, 1559 participants), including events such as breast pain (RR 22.97, 95% CI 14.79 to 35.67, eight studies, 2670 participants), gynaecomastia (RR 8.43, 95% CI 3.19 to 22.28, nine studies, 2774 participants) and asthenia (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.31, five studies, 2073 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	The risk of other adverse events, such as hot flashes (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.27, nine studies, 2774 participants), haemorrhage (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54, two studies, 546 participants), nocturia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.69, one study, 480 participants), fatigue (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.88, one study, 51 participants), loss of sexual interest (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83, one study, 51 participants) and urinary frequency (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.47, one study, 480 participants) was decreased when non-steroidal antiandrogens were used.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	The quality of evidence for breast pain, gynaecomastia and hot flashes was rated as moderate according to GRADE.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	The effects of non-steroidal antiandrogens on cancer-specific survival and biochemical progression remained unclear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	Currently available evidence suggests that use of non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with medical or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer is less effective in terms of overall survival, clinical progression, treatment failure and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	Evidence quality was rated as moderate according to GRADE.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	Further research is likely to have an important impact on results for patients with advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancer treated with non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	However, we believe that research is likely not necessary on non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy for men with metastatic prostate cancer.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	Only high-quality, randomised controlled trials with long-term follow-up should be conducted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009266.pub2	If further research is planned to investigate biochemical progression, studies with standardised follow-up schedules using measurements of prostate-specific antigen based on current guidelines should be conducted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	Eight eligible trials were identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	We excluded a trial because the randomisation had failed to produce comparable groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	The eligible trials included 600,000 women in the analyses in the age range 39 to 74 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality at 13 years (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.02); four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality with an RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.83).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	The RR for all seven trials combined was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.87).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favour of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	The trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of screening on total cancer mortality, including breast cancer, after 10 years (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10) or on all-cause mortality after 13 years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	Total numbers of lumpectomies and mastectomies were significantly larger in the screened groups (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.42), as were number of mastectomies (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	The use of radiotherapy was similarly increased whereas there was no difference in the use of chemotherapy (data available in only two trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	To help ensure that the women are fully informed before they decide whether or not to attend screening, we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	Because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out, it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub5	Recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	We included four studies, with a total of 522 women, in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	One of these studies did not report outcomes per woman randomised, and so was not included in formal analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	Three studies investigated 10,000 units hCG priming compared to no priming.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	One study investigated 20,000 units hCG compared to 10,000 units hCG priming.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	Three studies only included women with PCOS (N = 122), while this was an exclusion criteria in the fourth study (N = 400).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	We rated all four studies as having an unclear risk of bias in more than one of the seven domains assessed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	The quality of the evidence was low, the main limitations being lack of blinding and imprecision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	When 10,000 units hCG priming was compared to no priming, we found no evidence of a difference in the live birth rates per woman randomised (OR 0.65, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.24 to 1.74; one RCT; N = 82; low quality evidence); miscarriage rate (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.72; two RCTs; N = 282; I² statistic = 21%; low quality evidence), or clinical pregnancy rate (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.03; two RCTs, N = 282, I² statistic = 0%, low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	Though inconclusive, our findings suggested that hCG may be associated with a reduction in clinical pregnancy rates; 22% of women who received no priming achieved pregnancy, while between 7% and 23% of women who received hCG priming did so.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	The study comparing 20,000 units hCG with 10,000 units hCG did not report sufficient data to enable us to calculate odds ratios.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	No studies reported on adverse events (other than miscarriage) or drug reactions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	This review found no conclusive evidence that hCG priming had an effect on live birth, pregnancy, or miscarriage rates in IVM.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	There was low quality evidence that suggested that hCG priming may reduce clinical pregnancy rates, however, these findings were limited by the small number of data included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	As no data were available on adverse events (other than miscarriage) or on drug reactions, we could not adequately assess the safety of hCG priming.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008720.pub2	We need further evidence from well-designed RCTs before we can come to definitive conclusions about the role of hCG priming, and the optimal dose and timing.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	In total, 24 trials were included, but only 16 (10,114 women) had analysable data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	Meta-analyses showed no effects of either ERT or HRT on prevention of cognitive impairment after five and four years of treatment, respectively (odds ratio 1.34, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.9; odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.54 respectively) (trend favouring control in both instances).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	Analyses assessing the effects of treatment over time found that both ERT and HRT did not maintain or improve cognitive function and may even adversely affect this outcome (WMD = -0.45, 95% CI -0.99 to 0.09; WMD = -0.16, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.26, respectively at maximum follow up).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	Negative effects were found for ERT after one year and HRT after three and four years of therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	Results from smaller trials assessing effects on individual cognitive domains mostly reported no evidence of benefit.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	There is good evidence that both ERT and HRT do not prevent cognitive decline in older postmenopausal women when given as short term or longer term (up to five years) therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	It is not known whether either specific types of ERT or HRT have specific effects in subgroups of women, although there was evidence that combined hormone therapy in similarly aged women was associated with a decrement in a number of verbal memory tests and a small improvement in a test of figural memory.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether subgroups of women using specific types of hormone therapy could benefit from treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	It remains to be determined whether factors such as younger age (< 60 years of age), type of menopause (surgical or natural) and type of treatment (type of estrogen with or without a progestagen), mode of delivery (transdermal, oral or intramuscular) and dosage have positive effects at a clinically relevant level.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	In addition, whether the absence or presence of menopausal symptoms can modify treatment effects should be investigated in more detail.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003122.pub2	Large RCTs currently underway in the USA may be able to provide answers to these uncertainties by the year 2010.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	We included two studies with 880 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	We identified one ongoing trial with planned recruitment of 80 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	Included studies enrolled participants with both partially reversible and non-reversible COPD and baseline mean per cent predicted (%pred) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) of 43.4 to 49.6.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	Both studies lasted 12 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	Both studies used the same combination of inhaled ICS/LABA (fluticasone furoate and vilanterol 100/25 mcg once daily; FF/VI) versus LAMA (18 mcg tiotropium; TIO).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	They were published as full articles, and neither study was at low risk of bias in all domains.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	Compared to the TIO arm, results for pooled primary outcomes for the FF/VI arm were as follows: mortality: OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.73, 880 participants (deaths reported only in the TIO arm), very low-quality evidence; COPD exacerbation (requiring short-burst oral corticosteroids or antibiotics, or both): OR 0.72, 95% Cl 0.35 to 1.50, 880 participants, very low-quality evidence; pneumonia: reported in both studies only during treatment with FF/VI: OR 6.12, 95% Cl 0.73 to 51.24, 880 participants, very low-quality evidence; and total serious adverse events: OR 0.96, 95% Cl 0.50 to 1.83, 880 participants, very low-quality evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	None of the pneumonias were fatal.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	Compared to the TIO arm, we found no statistically significant difference for pooled secondary outcomes, including St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) mean total score change; hospital admissions (all-cause); disease-specific adverse events; mean weekly rescue medication use (results available from only one of the studies); and mean weekly percentage of rescue-free days for FF/VI.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	We found no statistically significant differences between ICS/LABA and LAMA for improvement in symptoms measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT score) nor for FEV₁ (change from baseline trough in 24-hour weighted mean on treatment day 84).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	Many pooled estimates lacked precision.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	Data for other endpoints such as exacerbations leading to intubation and physical activity measures were not available in included trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	Based on analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, we are uncertain whether once-daily ICS/LABA, combined in one inhaler, has a different efficacy or adverse effect profile compared to LAMA for treatment of people with COPD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	However, the current review is based on only two trials with the main focus on primary outcomes other than those considered in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	The short follow-up period and the very low quality of evidence limit our confidence in the result and increase uncertainty.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	Further trials of longer duration are needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012355.pub2	Current evidence is not strong enough to demonstrate important differences between inhalers in terms of effects, nor to establish that once-daily fluticasone/vilanterol 100/25 mcg and tiotropium 18 mcg are equivalent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005332.pub2	Two pharmacotherapy and three psychotherapy trials were eligible for inclusion in the review, with data from four short-term RCTs (169 participants) available for analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005332.pub2	Response data from a single placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine suggested overall superiority of medication relative to placebo (relative risk (RR) 3.07, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.72, n = 67).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005332.pub2	Symptom severity was also significantly reduced in the RCTs of fluoxetine and clomipramine (relative to desipramine), as well as in the two CBT trials (WMD -44.96, 95% CI -54.43 to -35.49, n = 73).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005332.pub2	A low relapse rate (4/22) was demonstrated in one trial of CBT.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005332.pub2	Results from the small number of available RCTs suggest that SRIs and CBT may be useful in treating patients with BDD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005332.pub2	The findings of these studies need to be replicated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005332.pub2	In addition, future controlled studies in other samples, such as adolescents, and using other selective SRIs, as well as a range of psychological therapy approaches and modalities (alone and in combination), are essential in supplementing the sparse data currently available.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005646.pub2	Three trials that examined cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and involving 268 adults were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005646.pub2	Meta-analysis of these studies found a beneficial effect of using a desensitization protocol over a rechallenge protocol at six months of follow-up for preventing discontinuation of cotrimoxazole (number needed to treat (NNT) 7.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.0-33.0), and for lower incidence of overall hypersensitivity (NNT 4.55, 95% CI 3.03-9.09).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005646.pub2	No severe hypersensitivity reactions occurred for either protocol in the three studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005646.pub2	In the small trials included in this review, when compared to cotrimoxazole rechallenge for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, cotrimoxazole desensitization resulted in fewer treatment discontinuations and overall adverse reactions in HIV-infected patients with a previous history of mild or moderate hypersensitivity to cotrimoxazole.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005646.pub2	Paediatric data and trials in resource-poor settings are urgently required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005646.pub2	Further randomised controlled trials are also needed for the treatment of opportunistic infections, treating-through, adjunctive medications, and different desensitization-dosing schedules.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	We included in the review three trials enrolling 148 neonates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	We identified no new trials for this update.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	Using different sedation scales, each study showed a statistically significantly higher sedation level in the midazolam group compared with the placebo group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	However, none of the sedation scales used have been validated in preterm infants; therefore, we could not ascertain the effectiveness of midazolam in this population.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	Duration of NICU stay was significantly longer in the midazolam group than in the placebo group (WMD 5.4 days, 95% CI 0.40 to 10.5; I2 = 0%; two studies, 89 infants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	One study (43 infants) reported significantly lower Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scores during midazolam infusion than during dextrose (placebo) infusion (MD -3.80, 95% CI -5.93 to -1.67).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	Another study (46 infants) observed a higher incidence of adverse neurological events at 28 days' postnatal age (death, grade III or IV IVH or PVL) in the midazolam group compared with the morphine group (RR 7.64, 95% CI 1.02 to 57.21; RD 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; NNTH 4, 95% CI 2 to 14) (tests for heterogeneity not applicable).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	We considered these trials to be of moderate quality according to GRADE assessment based on the following outcomes: mortality during hospital stay, length of NICU stay, adequacy of analgesia according to PIPP scores and poor neurological outcomes by 28 days' postnatal age.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	Data are insufficient to promote the use of intravenous midazolam infusion as a sedative for neonates undergoing intensive care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	This review raises concerns about the safety of midazolam in neonates.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002052.pub3	Further research on the effectiveness and safety of midazolam in neonates is needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001167.pub2	Twelve trials involving 767 participants were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001167.pub2	No differences were detected between the antibiotic and placebo/no treatment arms for people with diarrhoea at two to four days after treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 7.21; one trial, 46 participants; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001167.pub2	No difference was detected for the presence of diarrhoea at five to seven days after treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; two trials, 192 participants; very low quality evidence), clinical failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.25; seven trials, 440 participants; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001167.pub2	The mean difference for diarrhoea was 0 days (95% CI -0.54 to 0.54; 202 participants, four studies; low quality evidence);for fever was 0.27 days (95% CI -0.11 to 0.65; 107 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence); and for duration of illness was 0 days (95% CI -0.68 to 0.68; 116 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001167.pub2	Quinolone antibiotic treatment resulted in a significantly higher number of negative stool cultures for NTS during the first week of treatment (microbiological failure: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.56; 166 participants, four trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001167.pub2	Antibiotic treatment meant passage of the same Salmonella serovar one month after treatment was almost twice as likely (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.98; 112 participants, three trials), which was statistically significant.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001167.pub2	Non-severe adverse drug reactions were more common among the patients who received antibiotic treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001167.pub2	There is no evidence of benefit for antibiotics in NTS diarrhoea in otherwise healthy people.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001167.pub2	We are uncertain of the effects in very young people, very old people, and in people with severe and extraintestinal disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001167.pub2	A slightly higher number of adverse events were noted in people who received antibiotic treatment for NTS.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	We included 23 studies (n = 4192) assessing the accuracy of IL-6 for the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill adults.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	Twenty studies that were available as conference proceedings only are awaiting classification.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	The included participants were heterogeneous in terms of their distribution of age, gender, main diagnosis, setting, country, positivity threshold, sepsis criteria, year of publication, and origin of infection, among other factors.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	Prevalence of sepsis greatly varied across studies, ranging from 12% to 78%.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	We considered all studies to be at high risk of bias due to issues related to the index test domain in QUADAS-2.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	The SROC curve showed a great dispersion in individual studies accuracy estimates (21 studies, 3650 adult patients), therefore the considerable heterogeneity in the collected data prevented us from calculating formal accuracy estimates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	Using a fixed prevalence of sepsis of 50% and a fixed specificity of 74%, we found a sensitivity of 66% (95% confidence interval 60 to 72).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	If we test a cohort 1000 adult patients under suspicion of sepsis with IL-6, we will find that 330 patients would receive appropriate and timely antibiotic therapy, while 130 patients would be wrongly considered to have sepsis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	In addition, 370 out of 1000 patients would avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy, and 170 patients would have been undiagnosed of sepsis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	This numerical approach should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations described above.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	Our evidence assessment of plasma interleukin-6 concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill adults reveals several limitations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	High heterogeneity of collected evidence regarding the main diagnosis, setting, country, positivity threshold, sepsis criteria, year of publication, and the origin of infection, among other factors, along with the potential number of misclassifications, remain significant constraints for its implementation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	The 20 conference proceedings assessed as studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review once they are fully published and evaluated.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	Further studies about the accuracy of interleukin-6 for the diagnosis of sepsis in adults that apply rigorous methodology for conducting diagnostic test accuracy studies are needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011811.pub2	The conclusions of the review will likely change once the 20 studies pending publication are fully published and included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	We included 29 trials (5718 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	All studies except one were at an unclear or high risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	Studies were small, reported low numbers of SSI events and were often not clearly reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	There were 16 trials that included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a 'clean' classification, five trials that included people undergoing what was considered 'clean/contaminated' surgery, with the remaining studies including people undergoing a variety of surgical procedures with different contamination classifications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	Four trials compared wound dressings with no wound dressing (wound exposure); the remaining 25 studies compared alternative dressing types, with the majority comparing a basic wound contact dressing with film dressings, silver dressings or hydrocolloid dressings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	The review contains 11 comparisons in total.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	Primary outcome: SSI	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	It is uncertain whether wound exposure or any dressing reduces or increases the risk of SSI compared with alternative options investigated: we assessed the certainty of evidence as very low for most comparisons (and low for others), with downgrading (according to GRADE criteria) largely due to risk of bias and imprecision.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	We summarise the results of comparisons with meta-analysed data below: - film dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.55), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	- hydrocolloid dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.78), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	- hydrocolloid dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following potentially contaminated surgery (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.51), very low certainty evidence downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	- silver-containing dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.62), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	- silver-containing dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following potentially contaminated surgery (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.37), very low certainty evidence downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	Secondary outcomes	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	There was limited and low or very low certainty evidence on secondary outcomes such as scarring, acceptability of dressing and ease of removal, and uncertainty whether wound dressings influenced these outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	It is uncertain whether covering surgical wounds healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI, or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the risk of SSI, improving scarring, reducing pain, improving acceptability to patients, or is easier to remove.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	Most studies in this review were small and at a high or unclear risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003091.pub4	Based on the current evidence, decision makers may wish to base decisions about how to dress a wound following surgery on dressing costs as well as patient preference.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	We included two randomised controlled trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	One trial compared oral 100 microgram (µg) selenium yeast tablets with placebo, taken from the first trimester until birth.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	The trial randomised 179 women but outcome data were only provided for 85 women.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	Eighty-three women were randomised to each arm of the trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	Sixty-one women completed the selenium arm, 44 of whom completed an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	In the placebo arm, 64 women completed the trial, 41 of whom completed an EPDS.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	This included study (n = 85) found selenium had an effect on EPDS scores but did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	There was a mean difference (MD) of -1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.92 to 0.12) of the self-reported EPDS completed by participants within eight weeks of delivery.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	There was a high risk of attrition bias due to a large proportion of women withdrawing from the study or not completing an EPDS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	This included study did not report on any of the secondary outcomes of this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	The other trial compared docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	The trial randomised 126 women at risk of postpartum depression to three arms: 42 were allocated to EPA, 42 to DHA, and 42 to placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	Three women in the EPA arm, four in the DHA arm, and one woman in the placebo arm were lost to follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	Women who were found to have major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, current substance abuse or dependence, suicidal ideation or schizophrenia at recruitment were excluded from the study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	The women who discontinued the intervention (five in the EPA arm, four in the DHA arm and seven in the placebo arm) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, while those who were lost to follow-up were not.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	Women received supplements or placebo from recruitment at a gestational age of 12 to 20 weeks until their final review visit six to eight weeks postpartum.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	The primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score at the fifth visit (six to eight weeks postpartum).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	No benefit was found for EPA-rich fish oil (MD 0.70, 95% CI -1.78 to 3.18) or DHA-rich fish oil supplementation (MD 0.90, 95% CI -1.33 to 3.13) in preventing postpartum depression.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	No difference was found in the effect on postnatal depression comparing EPA with DHA (MD -0.20, 95% CI -2.61 to 2.21).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	No benefit or significant effect was found in terms of the secondary outcomes of the presence of major depressive disorder at six to eight weeks postpartum, the number of women who commenced antidepressants, maternal estimated blood loss at delivery or admission of neonates to the neonatal intensive care unit.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to conclude that selenium, DHA or EPA prevent postnatal depression.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2	There is currently no evidence to recommend any other dietary supplement for prevention of postnatal depression.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	We identified 11 studies: 7 evaluated different infusion durations (803 participants), and 4 evaluated different peak doses (5280 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	Seven studies were RCTs addressing different anthracycline infusion durations; we identified long-term follow-up data for one of the trials in this update.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of clinical heart failure with an infusion duration of six hours or longer as compared to a shorter infusion duration (risk ratio (RR) 0.27; 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.81; 5 studies; 557 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	The majority of participants included in these studies were adults with different solid tumours.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	For different anthracycline peak doses, we identified two RCTs addressing a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m2 versus 60 mg/m2 or more, one RCT addressing a liposomal doxorubicin peak dose of 25 mg/m2 versus 50 mg/m2, and one RCT addressing an epirubicin peak dose of 83 mg/m2 versus 110 mg/m2.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	A significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure was identified in none of the studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	The participants included in these studies were adults with different solid tumours.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	High or unclear 'Risk of bias' issues were present in all studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	An anthracycline infusion duration of six hours or longer reduces the risk of clinical heart failure, and it seems to reduce the risk of subclinical cardiac damage.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	Since there is only a small amount of data for children and data obtained in adults cannot be extrapolated to children, different anthracycline infusion durations should be evaluated further in children.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	We identified no significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure in participants treated with a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 or more.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	Only one RCT was available for the other identified peak doses, so we can make no definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005008.pub4	More high-quality research is needed, both in children and adults and in leukaemias and solid tumours.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	We included 37 eligible trials with a total of 3110 randomised participants; nine of these were new studies since the last update (2009) and five studies had been previously excluded but were re-assessed and included during the 2017 update.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	We identified two ongoing studies from searches of clinical trials registers and database searches and two studies await classification.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	Studies included both adults and children with TBI.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	Most studies commenced treatment immediately on admission to hospital or after craniotomies and all treatment was maintained for at least 24 hours.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	Thirty-three studies reported data for mortality, 31 studies reported data for unfavourable outcomes (death, vegetative state or severe disability), and 14 studies reported pneumonia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	Visual inspection of the results for these outcomes showed inconsistencies among studies, with differences in the direction of effect, and we did not pool these data for meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	We considered duration of hypothermia therapy and the length of follow-up in collected data for these subgroups; differences in study data remained such that we did not perform meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	Studies were generally poorly reported and we were unable to assess risk of bias adequately.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	Heterogeneity was evident both in the trial designs and participant inclusion.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	Inconsistencies in results may be explained by heterogeneity among study participants or bias introduced by individual study methodology but we did not explore this in detail in subgroup or sensitivity analyses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	We used the GRADE approach to judge the quality of the evidence for each outcome and downgraded the evidence for mortality and unfavourable outcome to very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	We downgraded the evidence for the pneumonia outcome to low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	Despite a large number studies, there remains no high-quality evidence that hypothermia is beneficial in the treatment of people with TBI.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub5	Further research, which is methodologically robust, is required in this field to establish the effect of hypothermia for people with TBI.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006728	Three high-quality and three low-quality studies, involving 519 people with depression, were identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006728	The studies were very heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, and measuring instruments.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006728	Despite fairly good methodological quality and positive findings of some studies, evidence for the effectiveness of family therapy for depression did not exceed level 3 (limited or conflicting evidence), except for moderate evidence (level 2), based on the non-combined findings from three studies, indicating that family therapy is more effective than no treatment or waiting list condition on decreasing depression, and on increasing family functioning.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006728	The current evidence base is too heterogeneous and sparse to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of family therapy in the treatment of depression.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006728	At this point, use of psychological interventions for the treatment of depression for which there is already an evidence-base would seem to be preferable to family therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006728	Further high quality trials examining the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of explicitly defined forms of family therapy are required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008068.pub2	Three trials involving a total of 206 participants were included, all patients with vascular dementia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008068.pub2	All three included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008068.pub2	When analysing these trials together, there was significant beneficial effect of Duxil on the improvement of cognitive function measured by MMSE (WMD 2.04, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.66).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008068.pub2	No data on behaviour and death at the end of treatment and follow-up were available from the included trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008068.pub2	Two trials failed to show an improvement of functional performance measured by ADL (WMD -1.68; 95% CI -3.70 to 0.35).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008068.pub2	Of the three included trials, all described the adverse events in detail, there were no statistically significant differences across the trials (OR 4.84, 95%CI 0.55 to 42.67).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008068.pub2	Behaviour disturbance, quality of life, caregiver burden were not undertaken in the included trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008068.pub2	Due to the low methodological quality of included trials, small number of trials and probable publication bias, this review did not provide sufficient evidence to support the routine use of Duxil for the treatment of patients with dementia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008068.pub2	High-quality and large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm or refute these results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	Seven RCTs including 960 participants were identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	The quality of trials was generally low, with several studies at risk of selection bias, and no studies used blinding during treatment or outcome assessment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	There was a high level of statistical variation between the studies, which therefore reduces the reliability of the evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	The OR for seroma formation was 0.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.91, P = 0.03) in favour of a reduced incidence of seroma in participants with drains inserted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	There was no significant difference in infection rates between drainage and no drainage groups (OR = 0.70; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.12, P = 0.14).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	The mean difference in length of hospital stay, reported in four trials consisting of 600 participants, was 1.47 days greater in the drained population (95% CI 0.67 to 2.28, P = 0.0003).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	A mean difference of 0.79 fewer postoperative seroma aspirations was found in the drained population (95% CI 1.23 to 0.35 fewer, P = 0.0004) in two trials including 212 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	No significant difference in volume of seroma aspirations was reported (MD -19.44, 95% CI -59.45 to 20.57, P = 0.34) in three trials including 519 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	No significant difference in the incidence of lymphoedema was noted (OR 2.31 favouring no drainage, 95% CI 0.47 to 11.37, P = 0.30), with only six instances reported in three trials of 360 participants, nor was any significant difference in the incidence of haematoma observed (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 8.51, P = 0.53), with only five instances reported in two trials of 314 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	There is limited quality evidence that insertion of a drain following axillary lymphadenectomy reduced the odds of developing a seroma and reduced the number of post-operative seroma aspirations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006823.pub2	These benefits should be balanced against an increased length of hospital stay in the drained population.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	Eight studies with 390,769 participants were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	Five studies used a prospective cohort design, two were case-control studies and one a randomised controlled trial (RCT).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	The methodological quality was measured using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	The three prospective cohort studies were of high methodological quality, and two were of medium quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	The two case-control studies were of medium methodological quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	The results form the studies assessing associations between flavonoids, colorectal cancer and adenomas were contradictory.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	There was no evidence that total flavonoid intake reduced the risk of colorectal neoplasms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	The evidence for Isoflavones, Flavonols, Flavones and Flavanones was conflicting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	For Flavan-3-ols, the results from two studies suggested that increased intake of Flavan-3-ols reduced the risk of both CRC and colorectal adenomas.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	A statistically significant reduced risk of CRC was found with high intake of epicatechin.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	There was medium quality evidence to support that increased intake of procyanidin and phytoestrogen could reduced the incidence of CRC.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	There was no evidence that suggested that high anthocyanin intake had an inverse association with colorectal adenomas.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	There is insufficient and conflicting evidence regarding flavonoid intake and the prevention of colorectal neoplasms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	It is difficult to determine flavonoid intake.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009350.pub2	Therefore, more evidence is needed to clarify the association between flavonoids and colorectal neoplasms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	We included seven trials with 1369 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	All trials had high risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	Five trials used our first definition of slow responders, and three other trials (including one that used both definitions) used the second definition.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	None of the included trials mentioned our primary outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	However, regarding the secondary outcomes, extension of the treatment period to 72 weeks increased the sustained virological response according to both definitions (71/217 (32.7%) versus 52/194 (26.8%); risk ratio (RR) 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.92, P = 0.02, I2 = 8%; and 265/499 (53.1%) versus 207/496 (41.7%); RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.50, P = 0.006, I2 = 38%), with a risk difference of 0.11 and calculated number needed to treat of nine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	The end of treatment response was not significantly different between the two treatment groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	The number of participants who relapsed virologically was found to be lower in the groups that had been treated for 72 weeks using both definitions (27/84 (32.1%) versus 46/91 (50.5%); RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.86, P = 0.007, I2 = 18%, 3 trials; and 85/350 (24.3%) versus 146/353 (41.4%); RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47, 0.73, P < 0.000001, I2 = 0%, 3 trials).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	The length of treatment did not significantly affect the adherence (247/279 (88.5%) versus 252/274 (92.0%); RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07, P = 0.42, I2 = 69%, 3 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	In the single trial that reported adverse events, no significant difference was seen between the two treatment groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	This review demonstrates higher a proportion of sustained virological response after extension of treatment from 48 weeks to 72 weeks in HCV genotype 1 infected patients in whom HCV RNA was still detectable but decreased by ≥ 2 log after 12 weeks and became negative after 24 weeks of treatment, and in patients with detectable HCV RNA after four weeks of treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	The observed intervention effects can be caused by both systematic error (bias) and random errors (play of chance).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	There was no reporting on mortality and the reporting of clinical outcomes and adverse events was insufficient.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008516.pub2	More data are needed in order to recommend or reject the policy of extending the treatment period for slow responders.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	Only two studies (34 participants) met the inclusion criteria of this systematic review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	Both studies evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of EUS in assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic cancers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	There was low concerns about applicability for most domains in both studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	The overall risk of bias was low in one study and unclear or high in the second study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	The mean probability of unresectable disease after CT scan across studies was 60.5% (that is 61 out of 100 patients who had resectable cancer after CT scan had unresectable disease on laparotomy).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	The summary estimate of sensitivity of EUS for unresectability was 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.97) and the summary estimate of specificity for unresectability was 0.80 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.96).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	The positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 4.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 18.6) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.0 to 0.8) respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	At the mean pre-test probability of 60.5%, the post-test probability of unresectable disease for people with a positive EUS (EUS indicating unresectability) was 86.9% (95% CI 60.9% to 96.6%) and the post-test probability of unresectable disease for people with a negative EUS (EUS indicating resectability) was 20.0% (5.1% to 53.7%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	This means that 13% of people (95% CI 3% to 39%) with positive EUS have potentially resectable cancer and 20% (5% to 53%) of people with negative EUS have unresectable cancer.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	Based on two small studies, there is significant uncertainty in the utility of EUS in people with pancreatic cancer found to have resectable disease on CT scan.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	No studies have assessed the utility of EUS in people with periampullary cancer.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011515.pub2	There is no evidence to suggest that it should be performed routinely in people with pancreatic cancer or periampullary cancer found to have resectable disease on CT scan.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	There were 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis) included in this review: 20 studies (14 RCTs and 6 CCTs) included 1661 participants with anterior or mixed blepharitis and 14 studies (12 RCTs and 2 CCTs) included 508 participants with posterior blepharitis (MGD).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	Due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics among the included studies, with respect to follow-up periods and types of interventions, comparisons, and condition of participants, our ability to perform meta-analyses was limited.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	Topical antibiotics were shown to provide some symptomatic relief and were effective in eradicating bacteria from the eyelid margin for anterior blepharitis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	Lid hygiene may provide symptomatic relief for anterior and posterior blepharitis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	The effectiveness of other treatments for blepharitis, such as topical steroids and oral antibiotics, were inconclusive.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	Despite identifying 34 trials related to treatments for blepharitis, there is no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	Commercial products are marketed to consumers and prescribed to patients without substantial evidence of effectiveness.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	Any RCT designed for this purpose should separate participants by type of condition (e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or MGD) in order to minimize imbalances between groups (type I errors) and to achieve statistical power for analyses (prevent type II errors).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	Medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures, such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing, to determine effectiveness, as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	Outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2	It is important that participants be followed long-term, at least one year, to assess chronic outcomes properly.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009810.pub2	We included one trial with a total of 23 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009810.pub2	This study was at high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009810.pub2	None of our primary outcomes and only one of our secondary outcomes (reduction in volume of disease, assessed endoscopically) was measured in the study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009810.pub2	There was no significant difference between the groups (very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009810.pub2	Adverse effects reported included airway swelling requiring intubation in a child with severe RRP a few hours after photodynamic therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009810.pub2	There is insufficient evidence from high-quality randomised controlled trials to determine whether photodynamic therapy alters the course of disease or provides an added benefit to surgery in patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009810.pub2	Multicentre randomised controlled trials with appropriate sample sizes and long-term follow-up are required to evaluate whether photodynamic therapy is of benefit.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009810.pub2	Outcomes such as improvement in symptoms (respiratory function and voice quality) and quality of life should be measured in future trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	We identified 42 primary studies with 4220 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	Twenty studies provided accuracy data based on the number of individual participants (seven of which provided data with and without the use of contrast).	1

10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	These studies were generally of moderate to low quality: only three studies fulfilled all the QUADAS items; in six (40%) of the studies, the delay between the tests was unclear or longer than four weeks; in eight (50%), the blinding of either the index test or the reference standard was not clearly reported or was not performed; and in two studies (12%), the interpretation of the reference standard was not clearly reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	Eleven studies evaluated the accuracy of CE-CDUS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	These studies were of better quality than the CDUS studies: five (45%) studies fulfilled all the QUADAS items; four (36%) did not report clearly the blinding interpretation of the reference standard; and two (18%) did not clearly report the delay between the two tests.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	Based on the bivariate model, the summary estimates for CDUS were 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.91) for sensitivity and 0.93 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.96) for specificity whereas for CE-CDUS the estimates were 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.98) for sensitivity and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.98) for specificity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	Regression analysis showed that CE-CDUS was superior to CDUS in terms of sensitivity (LR Chi2 = 5.08, 1 degree of freedom (df); P = 0.0242 for model improvement).	0

10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	Regression testing showed evidence of statistically significant effect bias related to year of publication and study quality within individual participants based CDUS studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	Sensitivity estimates were higher in the studies published before 2006 than the estimates obtained from studies published in 2006 or later (P < 0.001); and studies judged as low/unclear quality provided higher estimates in sensitivity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	When regression testing was applied to the individual based CE-CDUS studies, none of the items, namely direction of the study design, quality, and age, were identified as a source of heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	Twenty-two studies provided accuracy data based on number of scans performed (of which four provided data with and without the use of contrast).	0

10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	Summary estimates for CDUS (18 studies) showed 0.72 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.85) for sensitivity and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.96) for specificity whereas summary estimates for CE-CDUS (eight studies) were 0.91 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.98) for sensitivity and 0.89 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.96) for specificity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	This review demonstrates that both ultrasound modalities (with or without contrast) showed high specificity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	For ruling in endoleaks, CE-CDUS appears superior to CDUS.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010296.pub2	In an endoleak surveillance programme CE-CDUS can be introduced as a routine diagnostic modality followed by CT scan only when the ultrasound is positive to establish the type of endoleak and the subsequent therapeutic management.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	We included seven studies, with 766 participants: four used intracutaneous injections, two subcutaneous, and one both.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	All reported on low back pain in labour only.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	Methodological quality was good, but four studies were at high risk of bias due to small size of treatment groups, incomplete outcome data, and performance bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	All studies reported treatment group mean or median scores, finding greater reduction in pain for sterile water.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	However, failure to demonstrate a normal distribution for pain intensity or relief, and use of different scales, meant meta-analysis was inappropriate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	No study reported primary dichotomous efficacy outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	One reported the number self-scoring 4/10 cm or more reduction in pain; significantly more had this outcome with sterile water (50% to 60%) than with placebo (20% to 25%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	There was no significant difference between sterile water and saline for rates of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 1.02), instrumental delivery (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.18), rescue analgesia (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.69), timing of delivery, or Apgar scores.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	Two studies reported that more women treated with sterile water would request the same analgesia in future.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	No study reported on women's satisfaction with pain relief, women's sense of control in labour, women's satisfaction with the childbirth experience, mother/baby interaction, rates of breastfeeding, maternal morbidity, infant long-term outcomes, or cost.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	No adverse events were reported other than transient pain with injection, which was worse with sterile water.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	The outcomes reported severely limit conclusions for clinical practice.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	We found little robust evidence that sterile water is effective for low back or any other labour pain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	Neither did we find any difference in delivery or other maternal or fetal outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009107.pub2	Further large, methodologically rigorous studies are required to determine the efficacy of sterile water to relieve pain in labour.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Twelve trials with a total of 1932 participants were included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	The overall postoperative chronic pain in the glue group was reduced by 37% (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91; 10 studies, 1418 participants, low-quality evidence) compared with the suture group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	However, the results changed when we conducted subgroup analysis with regard to the type of mesh.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Subgroup analysis of included studies using lightweight mesh showed the reduction of chronic pain was less profound and insignificant (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.17).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Subgroup analysis of included studies using heavyweight mesh resulted in a significant benefit from the fixation with glue (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.82).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Hernia recurrence was similar between the two groups (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.28; 12 studies, 1932 participants, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Fixation with glue was superior to suture regarding duration of the operation (MD −3.13, 95% CI −4.48 to −1.78; 9 studies, 1790 participants, low-quality evidence); haematoma (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.86; 10 studies, 1384 participants, moderate-quality evidence); and recovery time to daily activities (MD −1.26, 95% CI −1.89 to −0.63; 3 studies, 403 participants, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	We also investigated adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	There were no significant differences between the two groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	For superficial wound infection pooled analyses showed OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.37 to 4.11; 7 studies, 763 participants (low-quality evidence); for mesh/deep infection OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.83; 8 studies, 1393 participants (low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Furthermore, we investigated seroma (a postoperative swelling caused by fluid) (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.33); and persisting numbness (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.14).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Finally, six trials involving 1009 participants reported postoperative length of stay, resulting in non-significant difference between the two groups (MD −0.12, 95% CI: −0.35 to 0.10)	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Due to the lack of data, it was impossible to draw any distinction between synthetic glue and biological glue.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Eight out of 12 trials showed high risk of bias in at least one of the investigated domains.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Two studies were quasi-randomised controlled trials and the allocation sequence of one trial was not concealed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Nearly half of the included trials either did not provide adequate information or had high risk of bias regarding blinding processes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	The risk of bias for incomplete outcome data of all the included studies varied from low to high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Two trials did not report on some important outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	One study was funded by the manufacturer producing the fibrin sealant.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Therefore, according to the 'Summary of findings' tables, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for the outcomes is moderate to low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Based on the short-term results, glue may reduce postoperative chronic pain and not simultaneously increase the recurrence rate, compared with sutures for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein hernia repair.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Glue may therefore be a sensible alternative to suture for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein repair.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	Larger trials with longer follow-up and high quality are warranted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010814.pub2	The difference between synthetic glue and biological glue should also be assessed in the future.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000002.pub3	We located 32 studies addressing technical editing and 66 surveys of reference accuracy.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000002.pub3	Only three of the studies were randomised controlled trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000002.pub3	A 'package' of largely unspecified editorial processes applied between acceptance and publication was associated with improved readability in two studies and improved reporting quality in another two studies, while another study showed mixed results after stricter editorial policies were introduced.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000002.pub3	More intensive editorial processes were associated with fewer errors in abstracts and references.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000002.pub3	Providing instructions to authors was associated with improved reporting of ethics requirements in one study and fewer errors in references in two studies, but no difference was seen in the quality of abstracts in one randomised controlled trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000002.pub3	Structuring generally improved the quality of abstracts, but increased their length.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000002.pub3	The reference accuracy studies showed a median citation error rate of 38% and a median quotation error rate of 20%.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000002.pub3	Surprisingly few studies have evaluated the effects of technical editing rigorously.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000002.pub3	However there is some evidence that the 'package' of technical editing used by biomedical journals does improve papers.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000002.pub3	A substantial number of references in biomedical articles are cited or quoted inaccurately.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	We included 15 studies including 721 participants with cancer pain due to diverse types of malignancy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	All studies were performed on adults; there were no studies on children.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	The included studies were of adequate methodological quality, but all except for one were judged to be at a high risk of bias because of small study size, and six because of methods used to deal with missing data or high withdrawal rates.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Three studies used a parallel group design; the remainder were cross-over trials in which there was an adequate washout period, but only one reported results for treatment periods separately.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Twelve studies used codeine as a single agent and three combined it with paracetamol.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Ten studies included a placebo arm, and 14 included one or more of 16 different active drug comparators or compared different routes of administration.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Most studies investigated the effect of a single dose of medication, while five used treatment periods of one, seven or 21 days.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Most studies used codeine at doses of 30 mg to 120 mg.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	There were insufficient data for any pooled analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Only two studies reported our preferred responder outcome of 'participants with at least 50% reduction in pain' and two reported 'participants with no worse than mild pain'.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Eleven studies reported treatment group mean measures of pain intensity or pain relief; overall for these outcome measures, codeine or codeine plus paracetamol was numerically superior to placebo and equivalent to the active comparators.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Adverse event reporting was poor: only two studies reported the number of participants with any adverse event specified by treatment group and only one reported the number of participants with any serious adverse event.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	In multiple-dose studies nausea, vomiting and constipation were common, with somnolence and dizziness frequent in the 21-day study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Withdrawal from the studies, where reported, was less than 10% except in two studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	There were three deaths, in all cases due to the underlying cancer.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	We identified only a small amount of data in studies that were both randomised and double-blind.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Studies were small, of short duration, and most had significant shortcomings in reporting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	The available evidence indicates that codeine is more effective against cancer pain than placebo, but with increased risk of nausea, vomiting, and constipation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	Uncertainty remains as to the magnitude and time-course of the analgesic effect and the safety and tolerability in longer-term use.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006601.pub4	There were no data for children.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	A total of 12 trials (11 randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized trial) of 563 people with HbSS, HbSC or HbSβthal, aged six to 35 years old, were included in the review; the majority of participants were African-American.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks and the post-intervention assessments ranged from the end of the intervention period to 12 months after completion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	The heterogeneity of the included trials, which encompasses setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, interventional method and time of assessment, ranged from 'not important' to 'moderate to substantial' for different review outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	The overall risk of bias was low for selective reporting, unclear for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and blinding of outcome assessment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Incomplete outcome reporting and blinding of personnel showed mixed bias representations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Patient knowledge was assessed by four trials (160 participants) with moderate to substantial heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	There was evidence that educational programs improved patient knowledge, standardised mean difference 0.87 points (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 1.45, moderate quality evidence), which improved further when a trial with high bias was removed in a sensitivity analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Caregiver knowledge, reported in a single trial of 20 families, also showed an improvement, standardised mean difference 0.52 points (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.00, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	The effect on patient knowledge was sustained at longer follow-up periods, whereas the effect on caregiver knowledge was not sustained.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	There were two primary outcomes related to the effectiveness of educational programs on the recognition of signs and symptoms of disease-related morbidity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	No comparative data were reported for patients or caregivers (or both) recognising signs and symptoms leading to self-management.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Data from two trials were analysed for the utilization of health services and showed no evidence of an effect, mean difference 0.33 (95% confidence interval -0.57 to 1.23, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	With regard to the review's secondary outcomes, depression showed a statistically significant decline in intervention groups, standardised mean difference -0.66 points (95% confidence interval -1.18, to -0.14, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Adherence to treatment was not assessed in any of the identified trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	No effects of interventions were seen on coping, family relationships or health-related quality of life of patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	The quality of evidence was low for positive coping and moderate for child knowledge, healthcare utilization and depression.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	This suggests that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	This review identifies important positive effects of educational interventions on improving patient knowledge of sickle cell disease and depression.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Effects on patients' knowledge were maintained for longer than for caregivers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	The effect on knowledge was significant but small and whether it offers any clinical benefit is uncertain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Significant factors limiting these effects could be trials being under powered as well as attrition rates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Effects were not statistically significant in assessments of secondary outcomes, possibly due to the paucity of the number of trials and patients and caregivers.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Trials showed moderate to high heterogeneity which might impact the results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	To better study effects on outcomes, further controlled trials are needed with rigorous attention given to improve recruitment and retention and to decrease bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2	Predetermined protocols using similar measurements should be used across multiple sites.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	The review included six trials representing 2411 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	Only one study included participants with both focal and generalised onset seizures; the other five trials included participants with focal onset seizures only.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	All six studies included adult participants between 16 and 80 years old, and treatment periods ranged from 7 to 16 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	We judged two studies to have low risk of bias and four to have unclear risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	One study failed to provide details on the method used for allocation concealment, and one did not report all outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	One study did not describe how blinding was maintained, and another noted discrepancies in reporting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	Participants receiving brivaracetam add-on were significantly more likely to experience a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those receiving placebo (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.14; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	Participants receiving brivaracetam were also significantly more likely to attain seizure freedom (RR 5.89, 95% CI 2.30 to 15.13; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	The incidence of treatment withdrawal for any reason (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.74; 6 studies; low-quality evidence), as well as the risk of participants experiencing one or more adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.17; 5 studies; moderate-quality evidence), was not significantly different following treatment with brivaracetam compared to placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	However, participants receiving brivaracetam did appear to be significantly more likely to withdraw from treatment specifically because of adverse events compared with those receiving placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.33; 6 studies; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	Brivaracetam, when used as add-on therapy for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, is effective in reducing seizure frequency and can aid patients in achieving seizure freedom.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	However, add-on brivaracetam is associated with a greater proportion of treatment withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	It is important to note that only one of the eligible studies included participants with generalised epilepsy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	None of the studies included participants under the age of 16, and all studies were of short duration.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	Consequently, these findings are mainly applicable to adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011501.pub2	Future research should thus focus on investigating the tolerability and efficacy of brivaracetam during longer-term follow-up, and should also assess the efficacy and tolerability of add-on brivaracetam in managing other types of seizures and its use in other age groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	We included 38 studies, mostly from high-income countries, many of which explored mothers' perceptions of vaccine communication.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	Some focused on the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	In general, parents wanted more information than they were getting (high confidence in the evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	Lack of information led to worry and regret about vaccination decisions among some parents (moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	Parents wanted balanced information about vaccination benefits and harms (high confidence), presented clearly and simply (moderate confidence) and tailored to their situation (low confidence in the evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	Parents wanted vaccination information to be available at a wider variety of locations, including outside health services (low confidence) and in good time before each vaccination appointment (moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	Parents viewed health workers as an important source of information and had specific expectations of their interactions with them (high confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	Poor communication and negative relationships with health workers sometimes impacted on vaccination decisions (moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	Parents generally found it difficult to know which vaccination information source to trust and challenging to find information they felt was unbiased and balanced (high confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	The amount of information parents wanted and the sources they felt could be trusted appeared to be linked to acceptance of vaccination, with parents who were more hesitant wanting more information (low to moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	Our synthesis and comparison of the qualitative evidence shows that most of the trial interventions addressed at least one or two key aspects of communication, including the provision of information prior to the vaccination appointment and tailoring information to parents' needs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	None of the interventions appeared to respond to negative media stories or address parental perceptions of health worker motives.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	We have high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to several review findings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	Further research, especially in rural and low- to middle-income country settings, could strengthen evidence for the findings where we had low or very low confidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2	Planners should consider the timing for making vaccination information available to parents, the settings where information is available, the provision of impartial and clear information tailored to parental needs, and parents' perceptions of health workers and the information provided.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	We identified 10 trials from the search, with a total of 599 anorexia nervosa participants, and included them in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	Seven had been identified in the previous versions of this review and we now include three new trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	We now deem one previously identified ongoing trial to be ineligible, and six ongoing trials are new for this update.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	Two of the 10 trials included children.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	Trials tested diverse psychological therapies and comparability was poor.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	Risks of bias were mostly evident through lack of blinded outcome assessments (in 60% of studies) and incomplete data reporting (attrition bias).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	The results suggest that treatment as usual (TAU) when delivered by a non-eating-disorder specialist or similar may be less efficacious than focal psychodynamic therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	This was suggested for a primary outcome of recovery by achievement of a good or intermediate outcome on the Morgan and Russell Scale (RR 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.97; 1 RCT, 40 participants; very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	However there were no differences between cognitive analytic therapy and TAU for this outcome (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.00; 2 RCTs, 71 participants; very low-quality evidence), nor for body mass index (BMI).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	There were no differences in overall dropout rates between individual psychological therapies and TAU.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	Two trials found a non-specific specialist therapy (Specialist Supportive Clinical Management) or an Optimised TAU delivered by therapists with eating disorder expertise was similar in outcomes to cognitive behaviour therapy (BMI MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.91 to 0.91; 197 participants, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	When comparing individual psychological therapies with each other, no specific treatment was consistently superior to any other specific approach.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	Dietary advice as a control arm had a 100% non-completion rate in one trial (35 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	None of the trials identified any adverse effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	Insufficient power was problematic for the majority of trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	There was a suggestion in one trial that focal psychodynamic therapy might be superior to TAU, but this is in the context of TAU performing poorly.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	An alternative control condition of dietary advice alone appeared to be unacceptable, but again this is based on just one trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	Owing to the risk of bias and limitations of studies, notably small sample sizes, we can draw no specific conclusions about the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa in adults or older adolescents.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003909.pub2	Larger RCTs of longer treatment duration and follow-up are needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	The review included 516 participants from three RCTs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	One study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two trials: the first trial randomized 151 adults to receive either silicone oil or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponades; and the second trial randomized 271 adults to receive either silicone oil or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas tamponades.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	The third trial was a multi-center international trial and randomized 94 participants (age range not specified) to receive heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) and silicone oil) versus standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes, per the surgeon's preference).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	In participants with RD associated with PVR, outcomes after pars plana vitrectomy and infusion of either silicone oil, perfluropropane gas, or sulfur hexafluoride gas appeared comparable for a broad variety of cases.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	There were no significant differences between silicone oil and perfluoropropane gas in terms of the proportion of participants achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.31) or achieving macular attachment (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15) at a minimum of one year.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	Although sulfur hexafluoride gas was reported to be associated with significantly worse anatomic and visual outcomes than was silicone oil at one year (quantitative data not reported), there were no significant differences between silicone oil and sulfur hexafluoride gas in terms of achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity at two years (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.66).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	For macular attachment, participants treated with silicone oil received significantly more favourable outcomes than did participants who received sulfur hexafluoride at both one year (quantitative data not reported) and two years (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	The first two trials did not perform any sample size calculation or power detection.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	In the third trial, which had a power of 80% to detect differences, heavy silicone oil was not shown to be superior to standard silicone oil.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	There were no significant differences between standard silicone oil and heavy silicone oil in the change in visual acuity at one year using adjusted mean logMAR visual acuity (mean difference -0.03 logMAR; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.29).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	Adverse events were not reported for the first two trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	For the third trial, only the total number of adverse events was reported, and adverse events for each group were not specified.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	Of the 94 participants, four died, 26 had recurrent retinal detachment, 22 developed glaucoma, four developed a cataract, and two had capsular fibrosis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	All three trials employed adequate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	None of the trials employed masking of participants and surgeons, and only the third trial masked outcome assessors.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	The first trial had a large portion of participants excluded from the final analyses, while the other two trials were at low risk of attrition bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	All trials appear to be free of reporting bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	The first two trials were funded by the National Eye Institute, and the third trial was funded by the German Research Foundation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	The use of either perfluropropane or standard silicone oil appears reasonable for most patients with RD associated with PVR.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	Because there do not appear to be any major differences in outcomes between the two agents, the choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub3	Heavy silicone oil, which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, has not demonstrated evidence of superiority over standard silicone oil.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	We included five studies (involving 1819 women) in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	There was a lower risk of composite maternal mortality and severe morbidity for women randomised to receive planned early delivery (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83, two studies, 1459 women (evidence graded high)).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	There were no clear differences between subgroups based on our subgroup analysis by gestational age, gestational week or condition.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	Planned early delivery was associated with lower risk of HELLP syndrome (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93, 1628 women; three studies) and severe renal impairment (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.92, 100 women, one study).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	There was not enough information to draw any conclusions about the effects on composite infant mortality and severe morbidity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	We observed a high level of heterogeneity between the two studies in this analysis (two studies, 1459 infants, I2 = 87%, Tau2 = 0.98), so we did not pool data in meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	There were no clear differences between subgroups based on our subgroup analysis by gestational age, gestational week or condition.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	Planned early delivery was associated with higher levels of respiratory distress syndrome (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.18, three studies, 1511 infants), and NICU admission (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.40, four studies, 1585 infants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	There was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07, 1728 women, four studies, evidence graded moderate), or in the duration of hospital stay for the mother after delivery of the baby (mean difference (MD) -0.16 days, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.15, two studies, 925 women, evidence graded moderate) or for the baby (MD -0.20 days, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.17, one study, 756 infants, evidence graded moderate).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	Two fairly large, well-designed trials with overall low risk of bias contributed the majority of the evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	Other studies were at low or unclear risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	No studies attempted to blind participants or clinicians to group allocation, potentially introducing bias as women and staff would have been aware of the intervention and this may have affected aspects of care and decision-making.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	The level of evidence was graded high (composite maternal mortality and morbidity), moderate (caesarean section, duration of hospital stay after delivery for mother, and duration of hospital stay after delivery for baby) or low (composite infant mortality and morbidity).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	Where the evidence was downgraded, it was mostly because the confidence intervals were wide, crossing both the line of no effect and appreciable benefit or harm.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	For women suffering from hypertensive disorders of pregnancy after 34 weeks, planned early delivery is associated with less composite maternal morbidity and mortality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	There is no clear difference in the composite outcome of infant mortality and severe morbidity; however, this is based on limited data (from two trials) assessing all hypertensive disorders as one group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	Further studies are needed to look at the different types of hypertensive diseases and the optimal timing of delivery for these conditions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	These studies should also include infant and maternal morbidity and mortality outcomes, caesarean section, duration of hospital stay after delivery for mother and duration of hospital stay after delivery for baby.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2	An individual patient meta-analysis on the data currently available would provide further information on the outcomes of the different types of hypertensive disease encountered in pregnancy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	Six studies (including 142 participants) were eligible for inclusion.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	Two compared three-times-a-week prophylactic administration with on-demand treatment in children with hemophilia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	Pooled results from these two studies showed a rate ratio of 0.30 (95% confidence interval; 0.12 to 0.76) for all bleedings and 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.63) for joint bleedings favouring prophylaxis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	Results on the number of patients with preserved joints after three to seven years of follow-up were not pooled due to significant heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	Three of the remaining four studies evaluated hemophilia A; one showed a statistically significant decrease in frequency of joint bleeds with prophylaxis compared to placebo, with a rate difference of -10.73 (95% confidence interval -16.55 to -4.91) bleeds per year.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	Two studies compared two prophylaxis regimens, failing to demonstrate an advantage of one regimen over the other in terms of bleeding frequency.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	The fourth study evaluated hemophilia B and showed fewer joint bleeds with weekly (15 IU/kg) versus bi-weekly (7.5 IU/kg) prophylaxis, rate difference -3.30 (95% confidence interval -5.50 to -1.10) bleeds per year.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	Non-significant increases in both inhibitor and infectious complications were observed in patients on prophylaxis, which occurred more often when using long-term venous access.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	There is strong evidence from randomised controlled trials and observational trials that prophylaxis preserves joint function in children with hemophilia as compared to on-demand treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to confirm the observational evidence that prophylaxis decreases bleeding and related complications in patients with existing joint damage.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4	Well-designed randomised controlled trials and prospective observational controlled studies are needed to establish the best prophylactic regimen and to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic clotting factor concentrates in adult patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	We included one new study in this update.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	In total, 13 trials involving 1824 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review however, data in usable format were only available in 10 trials (732 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	Inadequate reporting of study methodology was a common feature of the trials preventing thorough assessment of study quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	We were unable to pool data for any of the outcomes due to the differences between the interventions assessed in the studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	Eight studies aimed to induce remission; overall survival did not differ significantly between treatment groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	Five studies aimed to maintain remission.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	In two out of three studies reporting survival, this was substantial but the difference was not statistically significant between treatment groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	Less aggressive treatment schedules appear to produce similar effects with less adverse event profiles.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	This review notes a preference in more recent studies for less aggressive care options for treatment of BL.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	However, the evidence for the relative effectiveness of interventions to treat BL is not strong as studies were small, underpowered and prone to both systematic and random error.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005198.pub3	We included one additional trial without change of conclusions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	Two studies involving 447 (with sample sizes 14 and 432) RhD negative women were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	The studies compared IM and IV administration of anti-D prophylaxis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	In both studies the women received a 1500 IU (300 microgram) dose of Rhophylac during week 28 of gestation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	There was no incidence of RhD alloimmunization in either of the studies, as the sample size was insufficient for meaningful comparison of this uncommon outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	One of the studies found that the mean anti-D IgG concentrations after IV and IM administration differed up to seven days (36.1 (2.6) ng/mL IV; 19.8 (8.7) ng/mL IM on day seven).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	However, from two to three weeks post-administration, the concentrations were similar for both routes of administration.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	None of the women involved in the studies developed antibodies against the RhD antigen.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	It appears that IM and IV administration of anti-D are equally effective.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	The number of included studies and the number of participants are not enough to assess whether there are any differences.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	Anti-D can be administered by IM or IV injection.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	The choice of IM or IV route of administration will depend on the available preparations, the dose to be administered and also on the patients' preferences.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007885.pub2	This review found insufficient information upon which to guide practice due to the limited number of included studies, small sample sizes and methodological limitations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	Eight studies with a total of 21,379 patients with diabetes were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	Three included studies investigated ticlopidine compared to aspirin or placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	Five included studies investigated clopidogrel compared to aspirin or a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole, or compared clopidogrel in combination with aspirin to aspirin alone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	All trials included patients with previous CVD except the CHARISMA trial which included patients with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	Overall the risk of bias of the trials was low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	The mean duration of follow-up ranged from 365 days to 913 days.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	Data for diabetes patients on all-cause mortality, vascular mortality and myocardial infarction were only available for one trial (355 patients).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	This trial compared ticlopidine to placebo and did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences for all-cause mortality, vascular mortality or myocardial infarction.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	Diabetes outcome data for stroke were available in three trials (31% of total diabetes participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	Overall pooling of two (statistically heterogeneous) studies showed no statistically significant reduction in the combination of fatal and non-fatal stroke (359/3194 (11.2%) versus 356/3146 (11.3%), random effects odds ratio (OR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.49) for ADP receptor antagonists versus other antiplatelet drugs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	There were no data available from any of the trials on peripheral vascular disease, health-related quality of life, adverse events specifically for patients with diabetes, or costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	The available evidence for ADP receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes mellitus is limited and most trials do not report outcomes for patients with diabetes separately.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	Therefore, recommendations for the use of ADP receptor antagonists for the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes are based on available evidence from trials including patients with and without diabetes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005449.pub2	Trials with diabetes patients and subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes in trials with combined populations are needed to provide a more robust evidence base to guide clinical management in patients with diabetes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Ten trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 191 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Seven trials evaluated single treatment sessions, one evaluated a two-week intervention, one evaluated a six-week intervention and one a three-month intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	It is only possible to blind trials of airway clearance and overnight ventilatory support to the outcome assessors.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	In most of the trials we judged there was an unclear risk of bias with regards to blinding due to inadequate descriptions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	The six-week trial was the only one judged to have a low risk of bias for all other domains.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	One single intervention trial had a low risk of bias for the randomisation procedure with the remaining trials judged to have an unclear risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Most trials had a low risk of bias with regard to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Six trials (151 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance compared with an alternative chest physiotherapy method such as the active cycle of breathing techniques or positive expiratory pressure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Three trials used nasal masks, one used a nasal mask or mouthpiece and one trial used a face mask and in one trial it is unclear.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Three of the trials reported on one of the review's primary outcome measures (quality of life).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Results for the reviews secondary outcomes showed that airway clearance may be easier with non-invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	We were unable to find any evidence that non-invasive ventilation increases sputum expectoration, but it did improve some lung function parameters.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Three trials (27 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation for overnight ventilatory support compared to oxygen or room air using nasal masks (two trials) and nasal masks or full face masks (one trial).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Trials reported on two of the review's primary outcomes (quality of life and symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Results for the reviews secondary outcome measures showed that they measured lung function, gas exchange, adherence to treatment and preference, and nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Due to the small numbers of participants and statistical issues, there were discrepancies in the results between the RevMan and the original trial analyses.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	No clear differences were found between non-invasive ventilation compared with oxygen or room air except for exercise performance, which significantly improved with non-invasive ventilation compared to room air over six weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	One trial (13 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation on exercise capacity (interface used was unclear) and did not reported on any of the review's primary outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	The trial found no clear differences between non-invasive ventilation compared to no non-invasive ventilation for any of our outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Three trials reported on adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	One trial, evaluating non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance, reported that a participant withdrew at the start of the trial due to pain on respiratory muscle testing.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	One trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation for overnight support reported that one participant could not tolerate an increase in inspiratory positive airway pressure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	A second trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation in this setting reported that one participant did not tolerate the non-invasive ventilation mask, one participant developed a pneumothorax when breathing room air and two participants experienced aerophagia which resolved when inspiratory positive airway pressure was decreased.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Non-invasive ventilation may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who have difficulty expectorating sputum.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	Non-invasive ventilation, used in addition to oxygen, may improve gas exchange during sleep to a greater extent than oxygen therapy alone in moderate to severe disease.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	The effect of NIV on exercise is unclear.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	These benefits of non-invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single treatment sessions with small numbers of participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	The impact of this therapy on pulmonary exacerbations and disease progression remain unclear.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5	There is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials which are adequately powered to determine the clinical effects of non-invasive ventilation in cystic fibrosis airway clearance and exercise.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002878.pub2	This update of the systematic review on nocturnal-NIPPV in COPD (Wijkstra 2002), has led to the inclusion of three new studies, leading to seven included studies on 245 people.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002878.pub2	We obtained IPD for all participants in all included studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002878.pub2	The 95% confidence interval (CI) of all outcomes included zero.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002878.pub2	These included partial pressure of CO2 and O2 in arterial blood, six-minute walking distance (6MWD), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) and sleep efficiency.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002878.pub2	The mean effect on 6MWD was small at 27.7 m and not statistically significant.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002878.pub2	Given the width of the 95% CI (-28.1 to 66.3 m), the real effect of NIPPV on 6MWD is uncertain and we cannot exclude an effect that is clinically significant (considering that the minimal clinically difference on 6MWD is around 26 m).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002878.pub2	Nocturnal-NIPPV at home for at least three months in hypercapnic patients with stable COPD had no consistent clinically or statistically significant effect on gas exchange, exercise tolerance, HRQoL, lung function, respiratory muscle strength or sleep efficiency.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002878.pub2	Meta-analysis of the two new long-term studies did not show significant improvements in blood gases, HRQoL or lung function after 12 months of NIPPV.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002878.pub2	However, the small sample sizes of these studies preclude a definite conclusion regarding the effects of NIPPV in COPD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	We included four trials, involving 1190 women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	It was not possible to blind women and staff to the intervention, but for other 'Risk of bias' domains these studies were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Compared to expectant management, there was no clear effect of induction of labour for suspected macrosomia on the risk of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.09; 1190 women; four trials, moderate-quality evidence) or instrumental delivery (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.13; 1190 women; four trials, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Shoulder dystocia (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.98; 1190 women; four trials, moderate-quality evidence), and fracture (any) (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79; 1190 women; four studies, high-quality evidence) were reduced in the induction of labour group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	There were no clear differences between groups for brachial plexus injury (two events were reported in the control group in one trial, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	There was no strong evidence of any difference between groups for measures of neonatal asphyxia; low five-minute infant Apgar scores (less than seven) or low arterial cord blood pH (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.25 to 9.02; 858 infants; two trials, low-quality evidence; and, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.22; 818 infants; one trial, moderate-quality evidence, respectively).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Mean birthweight was lower in the induction group, but there was considerable heterogeneity between studies for this outcome (mean difference (MD) -178.03 g, 95% CI -315.26 to -40.81; 1190 infants; four studies; I2 = 89%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	In one study with data for 818 women, third- and fourth-degree perineal tears were increased in the induction group (RR 3.70, 95% CI 1.04 to 13.17).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	For outcomes assessed using GRADE, we based our downgrading decisions on high risk of bias from lack of blinding and imprecision of effect estimates.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia has not been shown to alter the risk of brachial plexus injury, but the power of the included studies to show a difference for such a rare event is limited.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Also antenatal estimates of fetal weight are often inaccurate so many women may be worried unnecessarily, and many inductions may not be needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Nevertheless, induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia results in a lower mean birthweight, and fewer birth fractures and shoulder dystocia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	The unexpected observation in the induction group of increased perineal damage, and the plausible, but of uncertain significance, observation of increased use of phototherapy, both in the largest trial, should also be kept in mind.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Findings from trials included in the review suggest that to prevent one fracture it would be necessary to induce labour in 60 women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Since induction of labour does not appear to alter the rate of caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery, it is likely to be popular with many women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	In settings where obstetricians can be reasonably confident about their scan assessment of fetal weight, the advantages and disadvantages of induction at or near term for fetuses suspected of being macrosomic should be discussed with parents.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Although some parents and doctors may feel the evidence already justifies induction, others may justifiably disagree.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Further trials of induction shortly before term for suspected fetal macrosomia are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000938.pub2	Such trials should concentrate on refining the optimum gestation of induction, and improving the accuracy of the diagnosis of macrosomia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	We identified 159 randomised clinical trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Ninety-four trials reported no mortality, and nine trials reported mortality but did not report in which intervention group the mortality occurred.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Accordingly, 56 randomised trials with 95,286 participants provided usable data on mortality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	The age of participants ranged from 18 to 107 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Most trials included women older than 70 years.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	The mean proportion of women was 77%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Forty-eight of the trials randomly assigned 94,491 healthy participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Of these, four trials included healthy volunteers, nine trials included postmenopausal women and 35 trials included older people living on their own or in institutional care.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	The remaining eight trials randomly assigned 795 participants with neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory or rheumatoid diseases.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Vitamin D was administered for a weighted mean of 4.4 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	More than half of the trials had a low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	All trials were conducted in high-income countries.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Forty-five trials (80%) reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Participants in 19 trials had vitamin	0

10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Participants in the remaining 26 trials had vitamin D insufficiency (less than 20 ng/mL).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Vitamin D decreased mortality in all 56 trials analysed together (5,920/47,472 (12.5%) vs 6,077/47,814 (12.7%); RR 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.99); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	More than 8% of participants dropped out.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	'Worst-best case' and 'best-worst case' scenario analyses demonstrated that vitamin D could be associated with a dramatic increase or decrease in mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	When different forms of vitamin D were assessed in separate analyses, only vitamin D3 decreased mortality (4,153/37,817 (11.0%) vs 4,340/38,110 (11.4%); RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98); P = 0.002; I2 = 0%; 75,927 participants; 38 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol did not significantly affect mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	A subgroup analysis of trials at high risk of bias suggested that vitamin D2 may even increase mortality, but this finding could be due to random errors.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Trial sequential analysis supported our finding regarding vitamin D3, with the cumulative Z-score breaking the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit, corresponding to 150 people treated over five years to prevent one additional death.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	We did not observe any statistically significant differences in the effect of vitamin D on mortality in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared with trials at high risk of bias; of trials using placebo compared with trials using no intervention in the control group; of trials with no risk of industry bias compared with trials with risk of industry bias; of trials assessing primary prevention compared with trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin D level below 20 ng/mL at entry compared with trials including participants with vitamin D levels equal to or greater than 20 ng/mL at entry; of trials including ambulatory participants compared with trials including institutionalised participants; of trials using concomitant calcium supplementation compared with trials without calcium; of trials using a dose below 800 IU per day compared with trials using doses above 800 IU per day; and of trials including only women compared with trials including both sexes or only men.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Vitamin D3 statistically significantly decreased cancer mortality (RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.98); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%; 44,492 participants; 4 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Vitamin D3 combined with calcium increased the risk of nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.34); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%; 42,876 participants; 4 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of hypercalcaemia (RR 3.18 (95% CI 1.17 to 8.68); P = 0.02; I2 = 17%; 710 participants; 3 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Vitamin D3 seemed to decrease mortality in elderly people living independently or in institutional care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol had no statistically significant beneficial effects on mortality.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Both alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased hypercalcaemia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007470.pub3	Because of risks of attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of participants and of outcome reporting bias due to a number of trials not reporting on mortality, as well as a number of other weaknesses in our evidence, further placebo-controlled randomised trials seem warranted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004096.pub2	A sufficient number of studies were available for a quantitative synthesis for fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004096.pub2	Twenty two randomized controlled trials were included in the review, with a total of 296 participants for fluoxitine, 2036 for orlistat, and 1047 for sibutramine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004096.pub2	Pharmacotherapy produced modest reductions in weight for fluoxetine (5.1 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 - 6.9) at 24 to 26 weeks follow up; orlistat 2.0 kg (CI, 1.3 - 2.8) at 12 to 57 weeks follow-up, and sibutramine 5.1 kg (CI, 3.2 - 7.0) at 12 to 52 weeks follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004096.pub2	Glycated hemoglobin also modestly and significantly reduced for fluoxetine and orlistat.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004096.pub2	Gastrointestinal side effects were common with orlistat; tremor, somnolence and sweating with fluoxetine; and palpitations with sibutramine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004096.pub2	Some studies, using a variety of study designs, were available on other drugs and a significant decrease in weight was noted in three studies of mazindol, one of phenmetrazine, two of phentermine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004096.pub2	No studies were identified that fit inclusion criteria for pseudoephedrine, ephedra, sertraline, yohimbine, amphetamine or its derivatives, bupropion, topiramate, benzocaine, threachlorocitric acid, sertraline, and bromocriptine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004096.pub2	Fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine can achieve statistically significant weight loss over 12 to 57 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004096.pub2	The magnitude of weight loss is modest, however, and the long-term health benefits remain unclear.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD004096.pub2	There is a paucity of data on other drugs for weight loss or control in persons with type 2 diabetes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	Five studies involving a total of 734 participants were eligible for inclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	We assessed only one study as good quality and the other four as poor quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	However, it was difficult to perform a meta-analysis by extracting aggregate data to synthesise the results as originally planned, mainly because not all studies reported the same outcomes as those chosen for this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	No significant differences favoured VGB or CBZ in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and time to achieve six-month remission after dose stabilisation from randomisation, but results did show a disadvantage for VGB on time to first seizure after randomisation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	Compared with CBZ, VGB was associated with more occurrences of weight gain and fewer occurrences of skin rash and drowsiness.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	No differences in visual field defects and visual disturbances were noted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	Data are currently insufficient to address the risk-benefit balance of VGB versus CBZ monotherapy for epilepsy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	Given the high prevalence of visual field defects reported in an existing systematic review of observational studies (Maguire 2010), VGB monotherapy should be prescribed with caution for epilepsy and should not be considered a first-line choice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	If necessary, the visual field should be frequently assessed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	Future research should focus on investigating the reasons for visual field defects and exploring potential prevention strategies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008781.pub3	Moreover, future monotherapy studies of epilepsy should report results according to the recommendations of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Commission, and methodological quality should be improved.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	We identified four RCTs fitting the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	However, two of these closed prematurely due to low recruitment and did not report results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	The remaining two trials evaluated 600 participants with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	In both studies the experimental group received G-CSF plus plerixafor and the control group received G-CSF plus placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	The meta-analysis showed no evidence for differences between plerixafor and placebo group regarding mortality at 12 months (600 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.69; P = 1.00; moderate-quality evidence) and adverse events during stem cell mobilisation and collection (593 participants; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.06; P = 0.19; high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	Regarding the outcome successful stem cell collection, the meta-analysis showed an advantage for those participants randomised to the plerixafor group (600 participants; RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.98 to 2.96; P < 0.00001; high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	As there was high heterogeneity between studies for the number of transplanted participants, we did not meta-analyse these data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	In the multiple myeloma study, 95.9% (142 participants) in the plerixafor arm and 88.3% (136 participants) in the placebo arm underwent transplantation (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.16); in the non-Hodgkin lymphoma trial, 90% (135 participants) in the plerixafor group versus 55.4% (82 participants) in the placebo group could be transplanted (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.89).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	In both trials there was no evidence for a difference between participants in the plerixafor and placebo group in terms of time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in transplanted participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	None of the trials reported on the outcomes quality of life and progression-free survival.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	The results of the analysed data suggest that additional plerixafor leads to increased stem cell collection in a shorter time.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	There was insufficient evidence to determine whether additional plerixafor affects survival or adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	The two trials included in the meta-analysis, both of which were conducted by the Genzyme Corporation, the manufacturer of plerixafor, were published several times.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	Two more RCTs examining the addition of plerixafor to a G-CSF mobilisation regimen terminated early without publishing any outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	The trials included nine and five participants, respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	Another RCT with 100 participants was recently completed, but has not yet published outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010615.pub2	Due to the unpublished RCTs, it is possible that our review is affected by publication bias, even though two trials failed to recruit a sufficient number of participants to analyse any data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	We included 23 trials involving 1806 women, of whom 717 received cones.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	All of the trials were small, and in many the quality was hard to judge.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	Outcome measures differed between trials, making the results difficult to combine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	Some trials reported high drop-out rates with both cone and comparison treatments.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	Cones were better than no active treatment (rate ratio (RR) for failure to cure incontinence 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.94).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	There was little evidence of difference for a subjective cure between cones and PFMT (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.13), or between cones and electrostimulation (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.87), but the confidence intervals were wide.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	There was not enough evidence to show that cones plus PFMT was different to either cones alone or PFMT alone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	Only seven trials used a quality of life measures and no study looked at economic outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	Seven of the trials recruited women with symptoms of incontinence, while the others required women with urodynamic stress incontinence, apart from one where the inclusion criteria were uncertain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	This review provides some evidence that weighted vaginal cones are better than no active treatment in women with SUI and may be of similar effectiveness to PFMT and electrostimulation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	This conclusion must remain tentative until larger, high-quality trials, that use comparable and relevant outcomes, are completed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2	Cones could be offered as one treatment option, if women find them acceptable.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008600.pub3	Eleven trials with a total of 2246 AF patients (ranging from 14 to 712 by study) were included within the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008600.pub3	Studies included education, decision aids, and self-monitoring plus education interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008600.pub3	The effect of self-monitoring plus education on TTR was uncertain compared with usual care (MD 6.31, 95% CI -5.63 to 18.25, I2 = 0%, 2 trials, 69 participants, very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008600.pub3	We found small but positive effects of education on anxiety (MD -0.62, 95% CI -1.21 to -0.04, I2 = 0%, 2 trials, 587 participants, low-quality evidence) and depression (MD -0.74, 95% CI -1.34 to -0.14, I2 = 0%, 2 trials, 587 participants, low-quality evidence) compared with usual care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008600.pub3	The effect of decision aids on decision conflict favoured usual care (MD -0.1, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.02, I2 = 0%, 2 trials, 721 participants, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008600.pub3	This review demonstrates that there is insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions regarding the impact of educational or behavioural interventions on TTR in AF patients receiving OAT.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008600.pub3	Thus, more trials are needed to examine the impact of interventions on anticoagulation control in AF patients and the mechanisms by which they are successful.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008600.pub3	It is also important to explore the psychological implications for patients suffering from this long-term chronic condition.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	Seventy randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (11,487 women) are included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	In this update seven new RCTs (778 women) have been added.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	Two of these new trials compare PGE2 with no treatment, four compare different PGE2 formulations (gels versus tablets, or sustained release pessaries) and one trial compares PGF2a with placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	The majority of trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	Overall, vaginal prostaglandin E2 compared with placebo or no treatment probably reduces the likelihood of vaginal delivery not being achieved within 24 hours.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	The risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes is increased (4.8% versus 1.0%, risk ratio (RR) 3.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 5.98, 15 trials, 1359 women).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	The caesarean section rate is probably reduced by about 10% (13.5% versus 14.8%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02, 36 trials, 6599 women).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	The overall effect on improving maternal and fetal outcomes (across a variety of measures) is uncertain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries (including sustained release preparations) appear to be as effective as each other, small differences are detected between some outcomes, but these maybe due to chance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	Prostaglandins	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	PGE2 probably increase the chance of vaginal delivery in 24 hours, they increase uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart changes but do not effect or may reduce caesarean section rates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	They increase the likelihood of cervical change, with no increase in operative delivery rates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003101.pub3	PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries appear to be as effective as each other, any differences between formulations are marginal but may be important.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003062.pub2	Eleven potential studies were identified of which five, involving 247 infants, were included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003062.pub2	When compared to incubator care, cot-nursing resulted in no significant difference in mean body temperature (MD 0.02 degrees C; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.07, four trials), though the one trial that reported on episodes of hyperthermia found this to be statistically more common in the cot-nursing group (RR 1.48; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.09).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003062.pub2	There were no statistically significant differences in weight gain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003062.pub2	In the cot-nursing group, fewer infants were breast fed on discharge (typical RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.14, three trials, 150 infants) and fewer infants died prior to hospital discharge (typical RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.25, four trials, 235 infants) but these results failed to reach statistical significance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003062.pub2	The comparison of cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress versus incubator care, which included five trials and a total of 231 infants, produced similar results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003062.pub2	Cot-nursing with warming of the nursery resulted in statistically significantly smaller weight gain during week one compared to the incubator group in one trial that involved 38 infants (MD -5.90 g/kg/day; 95% CI -11.13 to -0.67) but no significant difference was found for weeks two and three.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003062.pub2	Cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress has similar effects to incubator care with regard to temperature control and weight gain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003062.pub2	Important clinical outcomes need to be investigated further using randomised controlled trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003062.pub2	This is especially the case in the situation of developing countries, where differences in these outcomes are likely to be encountered.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003062.pub2	As limited data is available on cot-nursing using a space-heated room, this method is not recommended as practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006966.pub3	We included three studies, involving 146 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006966.pub3	Two studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006966.pub3	The main finding of the review was that the two techniques may be equally successful at exposing PDCs (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.06; three studies, 141 participants analysed, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006966.pub3	One surgical failure was due to detachment of the gold chain (closed group).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006966.pub3	One study reported on complications following surgery and found two in the closed group: a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and pain during alignment of the canine as the gold chain penetrated through the gum tissue of the palate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006966.pub3	We were unable to pool data for dental aesthetics, patient-reported pain and discomfort, periodontal health and treatment time; however, individual studies did not find any differences between the surgical techniques (low- to very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006966.pub3	Currently, the evidence suggests that neither the open or closed surgical technique for exposing palatally displaced maxillary canine teeth is superior for any of the outcomes included in this review; however, we considered the evidence to be low quality, with two of the three included studies being at high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006966.pub3	This suggests the need for more high-quality studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006966.pub3	Three ongoing clinical trials have been identified and it is hoped that these will produce data that can be pooled to increase the degree of certainty in these findings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	We included three trials, involving 244 women.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	The prostaglandins used were PG E2 analogue (sulprostone) in 50 participants and PG E1 analogue (misoprostol) in 194 participants at a dose of 250 mcg and 800 mcg respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	The prostaglandins compared with placebo, were not superior in reducing the rate of manual removal of placenta (average risk ratio (RR) 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.27), severe postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15), need for blood transfusion (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.22), mean blood loss (mean difference (MD) -205.26 mL; 95% CI -536.31 to 125.79, random-effects) and the mean time from injection to placental removal (MD -7.00 minutes; 95% CI -21.20 to 7.20).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	Side-effects were no different between groups (vomiting, headache, pain and nausea between injection and discharge from the labour ward), with the exception of shivering, which was more frequent in women receiving prostaglandins (RR 10.00; 95% CI 1.40 to 71.49).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	We did not obtain any data for the primary outcomes of maternal mortality and the need to add another therapeutic uterotonic.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	Currently there is limited, very low-quality evidence relating to the effectiveness and the safety using prostaglandins for the management of retained placenta.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	Use of prostaglandins resulted in less need for manual removal of placenta, severe postpartum haemorrhage and blood transfusion but none of the differences reached statistical significance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	Much larger, adequately powered studies are needed to confirm that these clinically important beneficial effects are not just chance findings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	Similarly, no differences were detected between prostaglandins and placebo in mean blood loss or the mean time from injection to placental removal (minutes) or side-effects (vomiting, headache, pain and nausea between injection and discharge from the labour ward) except for 'shivering' which was more frequent in women who received prostaglandin.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	The included studies were of poor quality and there is little confidence in the effect estimates; the true effect is likely to be substantially different.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	We can not make any recommendations about changes to clinical practice.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010312.pub2	More high-quality research in this area is needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002271.pub2	We included six studies involving 355 infants - two using face mask CPAP, two CNP, one nasal CPAP and one both CNP (for less ill babies) and endotracheal CPAP (for sicker babies).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002271.pub2	For this update, we included no new trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002271.pub2	Continuous distending pressure (CDP) is associated with lower risk of treatment failure (death or use of assisted ventilation) (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.81; typical risk difference (RD) -0.20, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.10; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5, 95% CI 4 to 10; six studies; 355 infants), lower overall mortality (typical RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87; typical RD -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.04; NNTB 7, 95% CI 4 to 25; six studies; 355 infants) and lower mortality in infants with birth weight above 1500 g (typical RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.84; typical RD -0.28, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.08; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2.00 to 13.00; two studies; 60 infants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002271.pub2	Use of CDP is associated with increased risk of pneumothorax (typical RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.39 to 5.04; typical RD 0.10, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 17, 95% CI 17.00 to 25.00; six studies; 355 infants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002271.pub2	We found no difference in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days (three studies, 260 infants), as well as no difference in outcome at nine to 14 years (one study, 37 infants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002271.pub2	In preterm infants with respiratory distress, the application of CDP as CPAP or CNP is associated with reduced respiratory failure and mortality and an increased rate of pneumothorax.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002271.pub2	Four out of six of these trials were done in the 1970s.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002271.pub2	Therefore, the applicability of these results to current practice is difficult to assess.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002271.pub2	Further research is required to determine the best mode of administration.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009111.pub3	We included six studies (157 participants) in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009111.pub3	Meta analysis of two studies indicated that foam dressings do not promote the healing of diabetic foot ulcers compared with basic wound contact dressings (RR 2.03, 95%CI 0.91 to 4.55).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009111.pub3	Pooled data from two studies comparing foam and alginate dressing found no statistically significant difference in ulcer healing (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.44).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009111.pub3	There was no statistically significant difference in the number of diabetic foot ulcers healed when foam dressings were compared with hydrocolloid (matrix) dressings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009111.pub3	All included studies were small and/or had limited follow-up times.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009111.pub3	Currently there is no research evidence to suggest that foam wound dressings are more effective in healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes than other types of dressing however all trials in this field are very small.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009111.pub3	Decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as dressing cost and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	We identified three eligible trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	Two trials compared endoscopic intervention with surgical intervention and included a total of 111 participants: 55 in the endoscopic group and 56 in the surgical group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	Compared with the endoscopic group, the surgical group had a higher proportion of participants with pain relief, both at middle/long-term follow-up (two to five years: risk ratio (RR) 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 2.15) and long-term follow-up (≥ five years, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.05).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	Surgical intervention resulted in improved quality of life and improved preservation of exocrine pancreatic function at middle/long-term follow-up (two to five years), but not at long-term follow-up (≥ 5 years).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	No differences were found in terms of major post-interventional complications or mortality, although the number of participants did not allow for this to be reliably evaluated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	One trial, including 32 participants, compared surgical intervention with conservative treatment: 17 in the surgical group and 15 in the conservative group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	The trial showed that surgical intervention resulted in a higher percentage of participants with pain relief and better preservation of pancreatic function.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	The trial had methodological limitations, and the number of participants was relatively small.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	For patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis and dilated pancreatic duct, this review shows that surgery is superior to endoscopy in terms of pain relief.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	Morbidity and mortality seem not to differ between the two intervention modalities, but the small trials identified do not provide sufficient power to detect the small differences expected in this outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	Regarding the comparison of surgical intervention versus conservative treatment, this review has shown that surgical intervention in an early stage of chronic pancreatitis is a promising approach in terms of pain relief and pancreatic function.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007884.pub3	Other trials need to confirm these results because of the methodological limitations and limited number of participants assessed in the present evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010075.pub3	Only one trial was identified for inclusion in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010075.pub3	This trial was at a high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010075.pub3	This trial included 857 patients undergoing minor skin excision surgery in the primary care setting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010075.pub3	The wounds were sutured after the excision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010075.pub3	Patients were randomised to early post-operative bathing (dressing to be removed after 12 hours and normal bathing resumed) (n = 415) or delayed post-operative bathing (dressing to be retained for at least 48 hours before removal and resumption of normal bathing) (n = 442).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010075.pub3	The only outcome of interest reported in this trial was surgical site infection (SSI).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010075.pub3	There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed SSIs between the two groups (857 patients; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.48).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010075.pub3	The proportions of patients who developed SSIs were 8.5% in the early bathing group and 8.8% in the delayed bathing group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010075.pub3	There is currently no conclusive evidence available from randomised trials regarding the benefits or harms of early versus delayed post-operative showering or bathing for the prevention of wound complications, as the confidence intervals around the point estimate are wide, and, therefore, a clinically significant increase or decrease in SSI by early post-operative bathing cannot be ruled out.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010075.pub3	We recommend running further randomised controlled trials to compare early versus delayed post-operative showering or bathing.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	One non-blinded RCT comparing prednisone with no treatment in 35 eligible participants did not measure the primary outcome for this systematic review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	The trial had a high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	Neuropathy Impairment	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	Scale scores after 12 weeks improved in 12 of 19 participants randomised to prednisone, compared with five of 16 participants randomised to no treatment (risk ratio (RR) for improvement 2.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 4.52; very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	The trial did not report side effects in detail, but one prednisone-treated participant died.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	A double-blind RCT comparing daily standard-dose oral prednisolone with monthly high-dose oral dexamethasone in 40 participants reported none of the prespecified outcomes for this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	The trial had a low risk of bias, but the quality of evidence was limited as it came from a single small study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	There was little or no difference in number of participants who achieved remission (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45 in favour of monthly dexamethasone; moderate-quality evidence), or change in disability or impairment after one year (low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	Change of grip strength or Medical Research Council (MRC) scores demonstrated little or no difference between groups (moderate-quality to low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	Eight of 16 people in the prednisolone group and seven of 24 people in the dexamethasone group deteriorated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	Side effects were similar with each regimen, except that sleeplessness was less common with monthly dexamethasone (low-quality evidence) as was moon facies (moon-shaped appearance of the face) (moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	Experience from large non-randomised studies suggests that corticosteroids are beneficial, but long-term use causes serious side effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	We are very uncertain about the effects of oral prednisone compared with no treatment, because the quality of evidence from the only RCT that exists is very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	Nevertheless, corticosteroids are commonly used in practice, supported by very low-quality evidence from observational studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	We also know from observational studies that corticosteroids carry the long-term risk of serious side effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	The efficacy of high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone is probably little different from that of daily standard-dose oral prednisolone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	Most side effects occurred with similar frequencies in both groups, but with high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone moon facies is probably less common and sleeplessness may be less common than with oral prednisolone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002062.pub4	We need further research to identify factors that predict response.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	Six studies including a total of 2100 participants met the inclusion criteria: we pooled four studies including 792 people in the main efficacy analyses, and presented the results of a cluster implementation study (n = 1213) and an oral steroid tapering study (n = 95) separately.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	Baseline characteristics relating to asthma severity were variable, but studies generally recruited people with asthma taking regular medications and excluded those with COPD or severe asthma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	One study compared the two types of check-up for oral steroid tapering in severe refractory asthma and we assessed it as a separate question.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	The studies could not be blinded and dropout was high in four of the six studies, which may have biased the results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	We could not say whether more people who had a remote check-up needed oral corticosteroids for an asthma exacerbation than those who were seen face-to-face because the confidence intervals (CIs) were very wide (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 7.44; 278 participants; one study; low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	In the face-to-face check-up groups, 21 participants out of 1000 had exacerbations that required oral steroids over three months, compared to 36 (95% CI nine to 139) out of 1000 for the remote check-up group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	Exacerbations that needed treatment in the Emergency Department (ED), hospital admission or an unscheduled healthcare visit all happened too infrequently to detect whether remote check-ups are a safe alternative to face-to-face consultations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	Serious adverse events were not reported separately from the exacerbation outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	There was no difference in asthma control measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or in quality of life measured on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) between remote and face-to-face check-ups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	We could rule out significant harm of remote check-ups for these outcomes but we were less confident because these outcomes are more prone to bias from lack of blinding.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	The larger implementation study that compared two general practice populations demonstrated that offering telephone check-ups and proactively phoning participants increased the number of people with asthma who received a review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	However, we do not know whether the additional participants who had a telephone check-up subsequently benefited in asthma outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	Current randomised evidence does not demonstrate any important differences between face-to-face and remote asthma check-ups in terms of exacerbations, asthma control or quality of life.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011715.pub2	There is insufficient information to rule out differences in efficacy, or to say whether or not remote asthma check-ups are a safe alternative to being seen face-to-face.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	Three out of 16 identified studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 212 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	All the included studies fulfilled at least seven of 10 methodological criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	The outcome data of the following measures were homogenous and were pooled in a meta-analysis: functional ability (n = 198; WMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.08), quality of life (CHQ-PhS: n = 115; WMD -3.96, 95% CI -8.91 to 1.00) and aerobic capacity (n = 124; WMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.19).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	The results suggest that the outcome measures all favoured the exercise therapy but none were statistically significant.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	None of the studies reported negative effects of the exercise therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	Overall, based on 'silver-level' evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) there was no clinically important or statistically significant evidence that exercise therapy can improve functional ability, quality of life, aerobic capacity or pain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	The low number of available RCTs limits the generalisability.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	The included and excluded studies were all consistent about the adverse effects of exercise therapy; no short-term detrimental effects of exercise therapy were found in any study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	Both included and excluded studies showed that exercise does not exacerbate arthritis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	The large heterogeneity in outcome measures, as seen in this review, emphasises the need for a standardised assessment or a core set of functional and physical outcome measurements suited for health research to generate evidence about the possible benefits of exercise therapy for patients with JIA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005954.pub2	Although the short-term effects look promising, the long-term effect of exercise therapy remains unclear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	We included 19 trials with 2663 participants (11 with outpatients, seven with inpatients, and one with ICU patients).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	For outpatients (with mild to moderate exacerbations), evidence of low quality suggests that currently available antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.94; I² = 31%; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 295 to 212 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 165 to 277).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Studies providing older antibiotics not in use anymore yielded an RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 31%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Evidence of low quality from one trial in outpatients suggested no effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.30).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	One trial reported no effects of antibiotics on re-exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Only one trial (N = 35) reported health-related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Evidence of moderate quality does not show that currently used antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure among inpatients with severe exacerbations (i.e. for inpatients excluding ICU patients) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.12; I² = 50%), but trial results remain uncertain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	In turn, the effect was statistically significant when trials included older antibiotics no longer in clinical use (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00; I² = 39%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Evidence of moderate quality from two trials including inpatients shows no beneficial effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 2.48, 95% CI 0.94 to 6.55).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Length of hospital stay (in days) was similar in antibiotic and placebo groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	The only trial with 93 patients admitted to the ICU showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45; moderate-quality evidence; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 565 to 107 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 45 to 254).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Results of this trial show a statistically significant effect on mortality (Peto OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72; moderate-quality evidence) and on length of hospital stay (MD -9.60 days, 95% CI -12.84 to -6.36; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Evidence of moderate quality gathered from trials conducted in all settings shows no statistically significant effect on overall incidence of adverse events (Peto OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.63; moderate-quality evidence) nor on diarrhoea (Peto OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.07; moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Researchers have found that antibiotics have some effect on inpatients and outpatients, but these effects are small, and they are inconsistent for some outcomes (treatment failure) and absent for other outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Analyses show a strong beneficial effect of antibiotics among ICU patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	Few data are available on the effects of antibiotics on health-related quality of life or on other patient-reported symptoms, and data show no statistically significant increase in the risk of adverse events with antibiotics compared to placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010257.pub2	These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that can help identify patients who would benefit from antibiotics, while sparing antibiotics for patients who are unlikely to experience benefit and for whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs, and multi-resistance) should be avoided.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3	We included nine RCTs randomising a total of 1414 participants (age range 24 to 70; mean age 45 to 59, where reported) to whole grain versus lower whole grain or refined grain control groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3	We found no studies that reported the effect of whole grain diets on total cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events (total myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, total stroke).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3	All included studies reported the effect of whole grain diets on risk factors for cardiovascular disease including blood lipids and blood pressure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3	All studies were in primary prevention populations and had an unclear or high risk of bias, and no studies had an intervention duration greater than 16 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3	Overall, we found no difference between whole grain and control groups for total cholesterol (mean difference 0.07, 95% confidence interval -0.07 to 0.21; 6 studies (7 comparisons); 722 participants; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3	Using GRADE, we assessed the overall quality of the available evidence on cholesterol as low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3	Four studies were funded by independent national and government funding bodies, while the remaining studies reported funding or partial funding by organisations with commercial interests in cereals.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3	There is insufficient evidence from RCTs of an effect of whole grain diets on cardiovascular outcomes or on major CVD risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3	Trials were at unclear or high risk of bias with small sample sizes and relatively short-term interventions, and the overall quality of the evidence was low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3	There is a need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs with longer durations assessing cardiovascular events as well as cardiovascular risk factors.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	Thirty-eight studies with a total of 1896 participants were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	Only one study was judged at low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	Eight studies were judged at high risk of selection bias because of lack of allocation concealment and over half the of the studies were at high risk of selective reporting bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	Three small studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	There was limited evidence from two studies (106 participants in total) of short-term benefit of using an air-stirrup versus an orthosis or a walking cast.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	One study (12 participants) found 12 weeks of hypnosis did not reduce activity or improve other outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	Thirty studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	In 10 studies, the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise was compared with cast immobilisation alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	Using a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise significantly reduced activity limitation in five of the eight studies reporting this outcome, reduced pain (number of participants with pain at the long term follow-up: 10/35 versus 25/34; risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.68; 2 studies) and improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	However, it also led to a higher rate of mainly minor adverse events (49/201 versus 20/197; RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.56; 7 studies).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	During the immobilisation period after surgical fixation, commencing weight-bearing made a small improvement in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (mean difference in the difference in range of motion compared with the non-fractured side at the long term follow-up 6.17%, 95% CI 0.14 to 12.20; 2 studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	Evidence from one small but potentially biased study (60 participants) showed that neurostimulation, an electrotherapy modality, may be beneficial in the short-term.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	There was little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was the best.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	One study found no immobilisation improved ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of motion compared with cast immobilisation, but another showed using a backslab improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion compared with using a bandage.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	Five studies investigated different rehabilitation interventions following the immobilisation period after either conservative or surgical orthopaedic management.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	There was no evidence of effect for stretching or manual therapy in addition to exercise, or exercise compared with usual care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	One small study (14 participants) at a high risk of bias found reduced ankle swelling after non-thermal compared with thermal pulsed shortwave diathermy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	There is limited evidence supporting early commencement of weight-bearing and the use of a removable type of immobilisation to allow exercise during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	Because of the potential increased risk of adverse events, the patient's ability to comply with the use of a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise is essential.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005595.pub3	There is little evidence for rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management and no evidence for stretching, manual therapy or exercise compared to usual care following the immobilisation period.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD009513	A non-randomised trial of peer support group therapy for adolescents demonstrated no change in self-reported adherence, yet the percentage of participants with suppressed viral load increased from 30% to 80% (p=.06).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009513	The second non-randomised trial found that the percentage of children achieving >80% adherence was no different between children on a lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) regimen compared to children on a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase regimen (p=.781).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009513	However, the proportion of children achieving virological suppression was significantly greater for children on the LPV/r regimen than for children on the NNRTI-containing regimen (p=.002).	0

10.1002/14651858.CD009513	Two interventions, an LPV/r-containing regimen and peer support therapy for adolescents, did not demonstrate improvements in adherence, yet demonstrated greater viral load suppression compared to control groups, suggesting a different mechanism for improved health outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009513	Well-designed evaluations of interventions to improve paediatric adherence to ART are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007556.pub2	Five studies (696 participants) met the inclusion criteria; 24 participants were treated with fenoprofen 12.5 mg, 23 with fenoprofen 25 mg, 79 with fenoprofen 50 mg, 78 with fenoprofen 100 mg, 146 with fenoprofen 200 mg, 55 with fenoprofen 300 mg, 43 with zomepirac 100 mg, 30 with morphine 8 mg, 77 with codeine 60 mg, and 141 with placebo.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	Fourteen trials (1,724 analysed participants or ears).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections and other diagnoses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up usually short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week: relative risk (RR) was 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.59) (two trials, N = 197).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	No statistically significant difference was found between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) at weeks one or three: pooled RR were 0.89 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.32) (three trials, N = 402), and 0.97 (0.54 to 1.72) (two trials, N = 77), respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	A positive trend in favour of quinolones seen at two weeks was largely due to one trial and not significant after accounting for heterogeneity: pooled RR 0.65 (0.46 to 0.92) (four trials, N = 276) using the fixed-effect model, and 0.64 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.17) accounting for heterogeneity with the random-effects model.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	Topical quinolones were significantly better at curing CSOM than antiseptics: RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.67) at one week (three trials, N = 263), and 0.58 (0.47 to 0.72) at two to four weeks (four trials, N = 519).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	Meanwhile, non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) compared to antiseptics were more mixed, changing over time (four trials, N = 254).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	Evidence regarding safety was generally weak.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than no drug treatment or topical antiseptics; non-quinolone antibiotic effects (without steroids) versus no drug or antiseptics are less clear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	Studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics, although indirect comparisons suggest a benefit of topical quinolones cannot be ruled out.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004618.pub2	Further trials should clarify non-quinolone antibiotic effects, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications) and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether quinolones may result in fewer adverse events than other topical treatments.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	We included 21 studies with a total of 6253 participants (5515 were included in the analysis).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	Studies were conducted from 1974 to 2011, with 80% of the studies conducted in the 1970's, 1980's or 1990's.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	Most studies did not report study methods sufficiently and many had high applicability concerns.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	In 20 studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from all other diagnoses with a sensitivity of 57% (50.4% to 63.3%), and a specificity of 81.4% (74% to 87.1%)	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	In seven studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from non-psychotic mental health disorders with a sensitivity of 61.8% (51.7% to 71%) and a specificity of 94.1% (88% to 97.2%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	In sixteen studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from other types of psychosis with a sensitivity of 58% (50.3% to 65.3%) and a specificity of 74.7% (65.2% to 82.3%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	The synthesis of old studies of limited quality in this review indicates that FRS correctly identifies people with schizophrenia 75% to 95% of the time.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	The use of FRS to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will incorrectly diagnose around five to 19 people in every 100 who have FRS as having schizophrenia and specialists will not agree with this diagnosis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	These people will still merit specialist assessment and help due to the severity of disturbance in their behaviour and mental state.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	Again, with a sensitivity of FRS of 60%, reliance on FRS to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will not correctly diagnose around 40% of people that specialists will consider to have schizophrenia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	Some of these people may experience a delay in getting appropriate treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	Others, whom specialists will consider to have schizophrenia, could be prematurely discharged from care, if triage relies on the presence of FRS to diagnose schizophrenia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	Empathetic, considerate use of FRS as a diagnostic aid - with known limitations - should avoid a good proportion of these errors.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	We hope that newer tests - to be included in future Cochrane reviews - will show better results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	However, symptoms of first rank can still be helpful where newer tests are not available - a situation which applies to the initial screening of most people with suspected schizophrenia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010653.pub2	FRS remain a simple, quick and useful clinical indicator for an illness of enormous clinical variability.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	We included 10 RCTs, of which 5 were new to this update; all interventions were adjuncts to conventional therapy and were delivered in primary- and secondary-care settings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	There were 2003 participants in the 9 educational interventions and 44 participants in the 1 psychological study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	Some included studies had methodological weaknesses; for example, we judged four studies to have high risk of detection bias, attrition bias, or other bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	Our primary outcomes were participant-rated global assessment, reduction in disease severity (reported as objective SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis)), and improvement in sleep and quality of life.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	No study reported participant-rated global assessment or improvement of sleep.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	The largest and most robust study (n = 992) demonstrated significant reduction in disease severity and improvement in quality of life, in both nurse- and dermatologist-led intervention groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	It provided six standardised, age-appropriate group education sessions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	Statistically significant improvements in objective severity using the SCORAD clinical tool were recorded for all intervention groups when compared with controls.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	Improvements in objective severity (intervention minus no intervention) by age group were as follows: age 3 months to 7 years = 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 6.8; age 8 to 12 years = 6.7, 95% CI 2.1 to 11.2; and age 13 to 18 years = 9.9, 95% CI 4.3 to 15.5.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	In three of five studies, which could not be combined because of their heterogeneity, the objective SCORAD measure was statistically significantly better in the intervention group compared with the usual care groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	However, in all of the above studies, the confidence interval limits do not exceed the minimum clinically important difference of 8.2 for objective SCORAD.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	The largest study measured quality of life using the German 'Quality of life in parents of children with atopic dermatitis' questionnaire, a validated tool with five subscales.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	Parents of children under seven years had significantly better improvements in the intervention group on all five subscales.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	Parents of children aged 8 to 12 years experienced significantly better improvements in the intervention group on 3 of the 5 subscales.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	This update has incorporated five new RCTs using educational interventions as an adjunct to conventional treatment for children with atopic eczema.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	We did not identify any further studies using psychological interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	The inclusion of new studies has not substantially altered the conclusions from the original review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	The educational studies in both the original review and this update lack detail about intervention design and do not use a complex interventions framework.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	Few use an explicit theoretical base, and the components of each intervention are not sufficiently well described to allow replication.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	A relative lack of rigorously designed trials provides limited evidence of the effectiveness of educational and psychological interventions in helping to manage the condition of atopic eczema in children.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	However, there is some evidence from included paediatric studies using different educational intervention delivery models (multiprofessional eczema interventions and nurse-led clinics) that these may lead to improvements in disease severity and quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	Educational and psychological interventions require further development using a complex interventions framework.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	Comparative evaluation is needed to examine their impact on eczema severity, quality of life, psychological distress, and cost-effectiveness.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004054.pub3	There is also a need for comparison of educational interventions with stand-alone psychosocial self-help.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	Fourteen trials contributed to this review (753 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	There was some moderate quality evidence that HBOT was more likely to achieve mucosal coverage with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (risk ratio (RR) 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.6, P value = 0.003, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5; 246 participants, 3 studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	There was also moderate quality evidence of a significantly improved chance of wound breakdown without HBOT following operative treatment for ORN (RR 4.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 16.8, P value = 0.04, NNTB 4; 264 participants, 2 studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	From single studies there was a significantly increased chance of improvement or cure following HBOT for radiation proctitis (RR 1.72; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.9, P value = 0.04, NNTB 5), and following both surgical flaps (RR 8.7; 95% CI 2.7 to 27.5, P value = 0.0002, NNTB 4) and hemimandibulectomy (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8, P value = 0.001, NNTB 5).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	There was also a significantly improved probability of healing irradiated tooth sockets following dental extraction (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, P value = 0.009, NNTB 4).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	There was no evidence of benefit in clinical outcomes with established radiation injury to neural tissue, and no randomised data reported on the use of HBOT to treat other manifestations of LRTI.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	These trials did not report adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	These small trials suggest that for people with LRTI affecting tissues of the head, neck, anus and rectum, HBOT is associated with improved outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	HBOT also appears to reduce the chance of ORN following tooth extraction in an irradiated field.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	There was no such evidence of any important clinical effect on neurological tissues.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	The application of HBOT to selected participants and tissues may be justified.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	Further research is required to establish the optimum participant selection and timing of any therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005005.pub4	An economic evaluation should be undertaken.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2	We located 10 RCTs involving 2961 participating surgeons performing an operation in which the use of blunt needles was compared to the use of sharp needles.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2	Four studies focused on abdominal closure, two on caesarean section, two on vaginal repair and two on hip replacement.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2	On average, a surgeon that used sharp needles sustained one glove perforation in three operations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2	The use of blunt needles reduced the risk of glove perforations with a relative risk (RR) of 0.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.54) compared to sharp needles.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2	The use of blunt needles will thus prevent one glove perforation in every six operations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2	In four studies, the use of blunt needles reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries with a RR of 0.31 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.68).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2	Because the force needed for the blunt needles is higher, their use was rated as more difficult but still acceptable in five out of six studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2	The quality of the evidence was rated as high.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2	There is high quality evidence that the use of blunt needles appreciably reduces the risk of exposure to blood and bodily fluids for surgeons and their assistants over a range of operations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2	It is unlikely that future research will change this conclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	The review currently includes seven randomised trials involving 422 participants that compared trifluoperazine with low-potency antipsychotic drugs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	The size of the included studies was between 20 and 157 participants with a study length between four and 52 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	Overall, sequence generation, allocation procedures and blinding were poorly reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	Trifluoperazine was not significantly different from low-potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of response to treatment (trifluoperazine 26%, low-potency drug 27%, 3 RCTs, n = 120, RR 0.96 CI 0.59 to 1.56, moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	There was also no significant difference in acceptability of treatment with equivocal number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (trifluoperazine 20%, low-potency antipsychotics 16%, 3 RCTs, n = 239, RR 1.25, CI 0.72 to 2.17,low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	There was no significant difference in numbers with at least one adverse effect (trifluoperazine 60%, low-potency antipsychotics 38%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.60, CI 0.94 to 2.74, moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	However, at least one movement disorder was significantly more frequent in the trifluoperazine group (trifluoperazine 23%, low-potency antipsychotics 13%, 2 RCTs, n = 123, RR 2.08 CI 0.78 to 5.55, very low quality evidence) as well as incoordination (trifluoperazine 20%, low-potency antipsychotics 5%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 7.00, CI 1.60 to 30.66) and rigor (trifluoperazine 45%, low-potency antipsychotics 10%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 4.50, CI 1.58 to 12.84).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	No data were available for other outcomes of interest death, sedation and quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	The results did not show a difference in efficacy between trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	Trifluoperazine produced more movement disorders.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2	The number of randomised studies as well as their quality is low, the quality of evidence for outcomes of interest ranged from moderate to very low quality, so more, newer studies would be needed for conclusions about the relative effects of trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	We found nine eligible RCTs including 593 infants in total.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	These trials compared responsive with scheduled interval regimens in preterm infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	The trials were generally small and contained various methodological weaknesses including lack of blinding and incomplete assessment of all randomised participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	Meta-analyses, although limited by data quality and availability, suggest that responsive feeding results in slightly slower rates of weight gain (MD −1.36, 95% CI −2.44 to −0.29 g/kg/day), and provide some evidence that responsive feeding reduces the time taken for infants to transition from enteral tube to oral feeding (MD −5.53, 95% CI −6.80 to −4.25 days).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	GRADE assessments indicated low quality of evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	The importance of this finding is uncertain as the trials did not find a strong or consistent effect on the duration of hospitalisation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	None of the included trials reported any parent, caregiver, or staff views.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	Overall, the data do not provide strong or consistent evidence that responsive feeding affects important outcomes for preterm infants or their families.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	Some (low quality) evidence exists that preterm infants fed in response to feeding and satiation cues achieve full oral feeding earlier than infants fed prescribed volumes at scheduled intervals.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	This finding should be interpreted cautiously because of methodological weaknesses in the included trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005255.pub5	A large RCT would be needed to confirm this finding and to determine if responsive feeding of preterm infants affects other important outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003285.pub2	Two randomised trials with a total of 161 participants were included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003285.pub2	The studies did not report on mortality and rate of limb loss.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003285.pub2	One randomised trial with a total of 133 participants showed that there was a significant improvement in ankle brachial index (ABI) in participants who received folic acid compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.11, P < 0.001) and in participants who received 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) versus placebo (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10, P = 0.009).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003285.pub2	A second trial with a total of 18 participants showed that there was no difference (P non-significant) in ABI in participants who received a multivitamin B supplement (mean ± SEM: 0.7 ± 01) compared with placebo (mean ± SEM: 0.8 ± 0.1).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003285.pub2	No major events were reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003285.pub2	Currently, no recommendation can be made regarding the value of treatment of hyperhomocysteinaemia in peripheral arterial disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003285.pub2	Further, well constructed trials are urgently required.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	Two cluster-RCTs, with data from 503 dental practices, representing 821 dentists and 4771 patients, met the selection criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	We judged the risk of bias to be high for both studies and the overall quality of the evidence was low/very low for all outcomes, as assessed using the GRADE approach.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	One study used a factorial design to investigate the impact of fee-for-service and an educational intervention on the placement of fissure sealants in permanent molar teeth.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	The authors reported a statistically significant increase in clinical activity in the arm that was incentivised with a fee-for-service payment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	However, the study was conducted in the four most deprived areas of Scotland, so the applicability of the findings to other settings may be limited.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	The study did not report data on measures of health service utilisation or measures of patient outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	The second study used a parallel group design undertaken over a three-year period to compare the impact of capitation payments with fee-for-service payments on primary care dentists’ clinical activity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	The study reported on measures of clinical activity (mean percentage of children receiving active preventive advice, health service utilisation (mean number of visits), patient outcomes (mean number of filled teeth, mean percentage of children having one or more teeth extracted and the mean number of decayed teeth) and healthcare costs (mean expenditure).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	Teeth were restored at a later stage in the disease process in the capitation system and the clinicians tended to see their patients less frequently and tended to carry out fewer fillings and extractions, but also tended to give more preventive advice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	There was insufficient information regarding the cost-effectiveness of the different remuneration methods.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	Financial incentives within remuneration systems may produce changes to clinical activity undertaken by primary care dentists.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	However, the number of included studies is limited and the quality of the evidence from the two included studies was low/very low for all outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009853.pub2	Further experimental research in this area is highly recommended given the potential impact of financial incentives on clinical activity, and particular attention should be paid to the impact this has on patient outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	We included 21 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported in 54 papers involving over 17,000 women and their babies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	One trial did not contribute data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	Trials were generally at low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	Zinc supplementation resulted in a small reduction in preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.97 in 16 RCTs; 16 trials of 7637 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	This was not accompanied by a similar reduction in numbers of babies with low birthweight (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; 14 trials of 5643 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	No clear differences were seen between the zinc and no zinc groups for any of the other primary maternal or neonatal outcomes, except for induction of labour in a single trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	No differing patterns were evident in the subgroups of women with low versus normal zinc and nutrition levels or in women who complied with their treatment versus those who did not.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	The GRADE quality of the evidence was moderate for preterm birth, small-for-gestational age, and low birthweight, and low for stillbirth or neonatal death and birthweight.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	The evidence for a 14% relative reduction in preterm birth for zinc compared with placebo was primarily represented by trials involving women of low income and this has some relevance in areas of high perinatal mortality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	There was no convincing evidence that zinc supplementation during pregnancy results in other useful and important benefits.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5	Since the preterm association could well reflect poor nutrition, studies to address ways of improving the overall nutritional status of populations in impoverished areas, rather than focusing on micronutrient and or zinc supplementation in isolation, should be an urgent priority.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010496.pub2	Ten RCTs (1656 participants) met our inclusion criteria, and pharmaceutical industry funded none of these trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010496.pub2	All trials used probiotics as adjuvant therapy to antifungal drugs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010496.pub2	Probiotics increased the rate of short-term clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.24, 695 participants, 5 studies, low quality evidence) and mycological cure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10, 969 participants, 7 studies, low quality evidence) and decreased relapse rate at one month (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.68, 388 participants, 3 studies, very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010496.pub2	However, this effect did not translate into a higher frequency of long-term clinical cure (one month after treatment: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.33, 172 participants, 1 study, very low quality evidence; three months after treatment: RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.70, 172 participants, one study, very low quality evidence) or mycological cure (one month after treatment: RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.71, 627 participants, 3 studies, very low quality evidence; three months after treatment: RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.35, 172 participants, one study, very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010496.pub2	Probiotics use did not increase the frequency of serious (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.94; 440 participants, 2 studies, low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010496.pub2	We found no eligible RCTs for outcomes as time to first relapse, need for additional treatment at the end of therapy, patient satisfaction and cost effectiveness.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010496.pub2	Low and very low quality evidence shows that, compared with conventional treatment, the use of probiotics as an adjuvant therapy could increases the rate of short-term clinical and mycological cure and decrease the relapse rate at one month but this did not translate into a higher frequency of long-term clinical or mycological cure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010496.pub2	Probiotics use does not seem to increase the frequency of serious or non-serious adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010496.pub2	There is a need for well-designed RCTs with standardized methodologies, longer follow-up and larger sample size.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	We included seven trials (involving 696 participants) in this update of the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	The included trials were conducted in different countries, covering the full spectrum of the World Bank's economic classification, which enhances the applicability of evidence drawn from this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	Two trials were conducted in Germany and Italy which are high-income countries, while four trials were conducted in upper-middle income countries; two in Iran, one in Malaysia and the fourth in Turkey, and the seventh trial was conducted in Jordan, which is a lower-middle income country.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	In six trials all the participants met the inclusion criteria and in the seventh study, we included in the meta-analysis only the subgroup of participants who met the inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	We assessed the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the GRADE tool and the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	Downgrading of evidence was based on the high risk of bias in six of the seven included trials and a small number of events and wide confidence intervals for some outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	Treatment of miscarriage with progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment probably reduces the risk of miscarriage; (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 0.87; 7 trials; 696 women; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	Treatment with oral progestogen compared to no treatment also probably reduces the miscarriage rate (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.85; 3 trials; 408 women; moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	However treatment with vaginal progesterone compared to placebo, probably has little or no effect in reducing the miscarriage rate (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.21; 4 trials; 288 women; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	The subgroup interaction test indicated no difference according to route of administration between the oral and vaginal subgroups of progesterone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	Treatment of miscarriage with the use of progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment may have little or no effect in reducing the rate of preterm birth (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.44; 5 trials; 588 women; low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	We are uncertain if treatment of threatened miscarriage with progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment has any effect on the rate of congenital abnormalities because the quality of the evidence is very low (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.82; 2 trials; 337 infants; very-low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	The results of this Cochrane Review suggest that progestogens are probably effective in the treatment of threatened miscarriage but may have little or no effect in the rate of preterm birth.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub5	The evidence on congenital abnormalities is uncertain, because the quality of the evidence for this outcome was based on only two small trials with very few events and was found to be of very low quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	We identified a large number of trials of laser photocoagulation of diabetic retinopathy (n = 83) but only five of these studies were eligible for inclusion in the review, i.e. they compared laser photocoagulation with currently available lasers to no (or deferred) treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	Three studies were conducted in the USA, one study in the UK and one study in Japan.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	A total of 4786 people (9503 eyes) were included in these studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	The majority of participants in four of these trials were people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy; one trial recruited mainly people with non-proliferative retinopathy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	Four of the studies evaluated panretinal photocoagulation with argon laser and one study investigated selective photocoagulation of non-perfusion areas.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	Three studies compared laser treatment to no treatment and two studies compared laser treatment to deferred laser treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	All studies were at risk of performance bias because the treatment and control were different and no study attempted to produce a sham treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	Three studies were considered to be at risk of attrition bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	At 12 months there was little difference between eyes that received laser photocoagulation and those allocated to no treatment (or deferred treatment), in terms of loss of 15 or more letters of visual acuity (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.11; 8926 eyes; 2 RCTs, low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	Longer term follow-up did not show a consistent pattern, but one study found a 20% reduction in risk of loss of 15 or more letters of visual acuity at five years with laser treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	Treatment with laser reduced the risk of severe visual loss by over 50% at 12 months (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.86; 9276 eyes; 4 RCTs, moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	There was a beneficial effect on progression of diabetic retinopathy with treated eyes experiencing a 50% reduction in risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.64; 8331 eyes; 4 RCTs, low quality evidence) and a similar reduction in risk of vitreous haemorrhage (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.85; 224 eyes; 2 RCTs, low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	None of the studies reported near visual acuity or patient-relevant outcomes such as quality of life, pain, loss of driving licence or adverse effects such as retinal detachment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	We did not plan any subgroup analyses, but there was a difference in baseline risk in participants with non-proliferative retinopathy compared to those with proliferative retinopathy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	With the small number of included studies we could not do a formal subgroup analysis comparing effect in proliferative and non-proliferative retinopathy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	This review provides evidence that laser photocoagulation is beneficial in treating proliferative diabetic retinopathy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	We judged the evidence to be moderate or low, depending on the outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	This is partly related to reporting of trials conducted many years ago, after which panretinal photocoagulation has become the mainstay of treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	Future Cochrane Reviews on variations in the laser treatment protocol are planned.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011234.pub2	Future research on laser photocoagulation should investigate the combination of laser photocoagulation with newer treatments such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	We included two trials involving 269 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	The participants were mostly men (67%); the mean age was 65 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	The trials were conducted in China and Italy (one was a multicentre trial).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	We judged both trials at high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	Compared to oxygen therapy, CPAP or bilevel NPPV may reduce the rate of tracheal intubation (risk ratio (RR) 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.83; low quality evidence) with a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 11.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	There was very low quality evidence that the intervention may also reduce ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) -1.84 days; 95% CI -3.53 to -0.15).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	We found no differences for mortality (low quality evidence) and hospital length of stay.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic leakage, pneumonia-related complications, and sepsis or infections.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	Findings from one trial of 60 participants suggested that bilevel NPPV, compared to oxygen therapy, may improve blood gas levels and blood pH one hour after the intervention (partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2): MD 22.5 mm Hg; 95% CI 17.19 to 27.81; pH: MD 0.06; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PCO2) levels (MD -9.8 mm Hg; 95% CI -14.07 to -5.53).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	The trials included in this systematic review did not present data on the following outcomes that we intended to assess: gastric insufflation, fistulae, pneumothorax, bleeding, skin breakdown, eye irritation, sinus congestion, oronasal drying, and patient-ventilator asynchrony.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	The findings of this review indicate that CPAP or bilevel NPPV is an effective and safe intervention for the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	However, based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, the quality of the evidence was low or very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009134.pub2	More good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	We included four trials involving 388 women that were judged to be at an unclear to high risk of bias overall.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	A variety of different agents for providing analgesia were assessed in the trials, and a number of different methods to measure pain relief were used, and thus results could not be combined in meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	Three trials compared diazepam with an alternative agent (ketamine; vinydan-ether; "other" anaesthesic agent) for the provision of general anaesthesia, and one trial compared spinal analgesia to pudendal nerve block (in both groups lignocaine was administered).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	With regard to the primary outcomes, women receiving diazepam for forceps delivery in one small trial were more likely to judge their pain relief as effective compared with women receiving vinydan-ether (risk ratio (RR) 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.25; 101 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	In a further small trial, no significant difference was seen in the number of women judging their pain relief as effective when diazepam was compared with ketamine (RR 1.42; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.07; 26 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	In the trial that compared spinal analgesia to pudendal nerve block, women receiving spinal analgesia were significantly more likely to regard their analgesia as adequate (RR 3.36; 95% CI 2.46 to 4.60; 183 women) and were less likely to report severe pain during forceps delivery (RR 0.02; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.27; 183 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	No trials reported on the review's other two primary outcomes of serious maternal adverse effects or complications, and neonatal mortality or serious morbidity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	In terms of secondary outcomes, women receiving diazepam compared with vinydan-ether, were significantly less likely to experience vomiting (RR 0.04; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.62; 101 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	No significant differences were seen for the few neonatal outcomes that were reported across any of the comparisons (including Agpar score of less than seven at five minutes and acidosis as defined by cord blood arterial pH less than 7.2).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to support any particular analgesic agent or method as most effective in providing pain relief for forceps delivery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008878.pub2	Neonatal outcomes have largely not been evaluated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	We included 15 RCTs with a total of 1048 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	Most of the trials were conducted in India, followed by Europe and the United States.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	The majority of participants were adults of both sexes with mild to moderate asthma for six months to more than 23 years.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	Five studies included yoga breathing alone, while the other studies assessed yoga interventions that included breathing, posture, and meditation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	Interventions lasted from two weeks to 54 months, for no more than six months in the majority of studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	The risk of bias was low across all domains in one study and unclear or high in at least one domain for the remainder.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	There was some evidence that yoga may improve quality of life (MD in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) score per item 0.57 units on a 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.77; 5 studies; 375 participants), improve symptoms (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.65; 3 studies; 243 participants), and reduce medication usage (RR 5.35, 95% CI 1.29 to 22.11; 2 studies) in people with asthma.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	The MD for AQLQ score exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.5, but whether the mean changes exceeded the MCID for asthma symptoms is uncertain due to the lack of an established MCID in the severity scores used in the included studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	The effects of yoga on change from baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (MD 0.04 litres, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.19; 7 studies; 340 participants; I2 = 68%) were not statistically significant.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	Two studies indicated improved asthma control, but due to very significant heterogeneity (I2 = 98%) we did not pool data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	No serious adverse events associated with yoga were reported, but the data on this outcome was limited.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	We found moderate-quality evidence that yoga probably leads to small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	There is more uncertainty about potential adverse effects of yoga and its impact on lung function and medication usage.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010346.pub2	RCTs with a large sample size and high methodological and reporting quality are needed to confirm the effects of yoga for asthma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	The review included 10 trials (249 participants) using different treatment regimens.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	Seven of the 10 trials assessed single agents, and 3 assessed combined agents.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	Many of the studies did not present adequate data for the reporting of the primary outcome of the review, which was the percentage change in muscle strength score at six months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	Pooled data from two trials of interferon beta-1a (n = 58) identified no important difference in normalised manual muscle strength sum scores from baseline to six months (mean difference (MD) -0.06, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.03) between IFN beta-1a and placebo (moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	A single trial of methotrexate (MTX) (n = 44) provided moderate-quality evidence that MTX did not arrest or slow disease progression, based on reported percentage change in manual muscle strength sum scores at 12 months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	None of the fully published trials were adequately powered to detect a treatment effect.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	We assessed six of the nine fully published trials as providing very low-quality evidence in relation to the primary outcome measure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	Three trials (n = 78) compared intravenous immunoglobulin (combined in one trial with prednisone) to a placebo, but we were unable to perform meta-analysis because of variations in study analysis and presentation of trial data, with no access to the primary data for re-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	Other comparisons were also reported in single trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	An open trial of anti-T lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) combined with MTX versus MTX provided very low-quality evidence in favour of the combined therapy, based on percentage change in quantitative muscle strength sum scores at 12 months (MD 12.50%, 95% CI 2.43 to 22.57).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	Data from trials of oxandrolone versus placebo, azathioprine (AZA) combined with MTX versus MTX, and arimoclomol versus placebo did not allow us to report either normalised or percentage change in muscle strength sum scores.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	A complete analysis of the effects of arimoclomol is pending data publication.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	Trials of interferon beta-1a and MTX provided moderate-quality evidence of having no effect on the progression of IBM.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	Overall trial design limitations including risk of bias, low numbers of participants, and short duration make it difficult to say whether or not any of the drug treatments included in this review were effective.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	An open trial of ATG combined with MTX versus MTX provided very low-quality evidence in favour of the combined therapy based on the percentage change data given.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	We were unable to draw conclusions from trials of IVIg, oxandrolone, and AZA plus MTX versus MTX.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001555.pub5	We need more randomised controlled trials that are larger, of longer duration, and that use fully validated, standardised, and responsive outcome measures.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	No new trials were identified for this first update.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	We included nine RCTs (3144 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	Linezolid was associated with a significantly better clinical (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16) and microbiological cure rate in adults (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	For those infections due to MRSA, linezolid was significantly more effective than vancomycin in clinical (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17) and microbiological cure rates (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.32).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	No RCT reported SSTI-related and treatment-related mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between linezolid and vancomycin (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.80).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	There were fewer incidents of red man syndrome (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.29), pruritus (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75) and rash (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.58) in the linezolid group compared with vancomycin, however, more people reported thrombocytopenia (RR 13.06, 95% CI 1.72 to 99.22), and nausea (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.94) when treated with linezolid.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	It seems, from the available data, that length of stay in hospital was shorter for those in the linezolid group than the vancomycin group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	The daily cost of outpatient therapy was less with oral linezolid than with intravenous vancomycin.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	Although inpatient treatment with linezolid cost more than inpatient treatment with vancomycin per day, the median length of hospital stay was three days shorter with linezolid.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	Thus, total hospital charges per patient were less with linezolid treatment than with vancomycin treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	Linezolid seems to be more effective than vancomycin for treating people with SSTIs, including SSTIs caused by MRSA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	The available evidence is at high risk of bias and is based on studies that were supported by the pharmaceutical company that makes linezolid.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008056.pub3	Further well-designed, independently-funded, RCTs are needed to confirm the available evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006053.pub6	We included eight RCTs with a total of 512 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006053.pub6	Our critical appraisal revealed vast heterogeneity with respect to methodological quality and outcome parameters.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006053.pub6	Postoperative mortality (OR 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.54; P = 0.32), overall survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; P = 0.29), and morbidity showed no significant differences, except of delayed gastric emptying, which significantly favoured CW (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.05 to 8.70; P = 0.04).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006053.pub6	Furthermore, we noted that operating time (MD -45.22 minutes, 95% CI -74.67 to -15.78; P = 0.003), intraoperative blood loss (MD -0.32 L, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.03; P = 0.03), and red blood cell transfusion (MD -0.47 units, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.07; P = 0.02) were significantly reduced in the PPW group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006053.pub6	All significant results were associated with low-quality evidence based on GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006053.pub6	Current evidence suggests no relevant differences in mortality, morbidity, and survival between the two operations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006053.pub6	However, some perioperative outcome measures significantly favour the PPW procedure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006053.pub6	Given obvious clinical and methodological heterogeneity, future high-quality RCTs of complex surgical interventions based on well-defined outcome parameters are required.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000565	Six RCTs involving 1862 participants were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000565	The effect of calcium channel blockers on the risk of death was reported in five of the RCTs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000565	The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the five studies was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.70 to 1.16).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000565	For the five RCTs that reported death and severe disability (unfavourable outcome), the pooled OR 0.97 (95%CI 0.81 to 1.18).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000565	In the two RCTs which reported the risk of death in a subgroup of traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage patients, the pooled OR 0.59 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.94).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000565	Three RCTs reported death and severe disability as an outcome in this subgroup, and the pooled OR 0.67 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.98).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000565	This systematic review of randomised controlled trials of calcium channel blockers in acute traumatic head injury patients shows that considerable uncertainty remains over their effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000565	The effect of nimodipine in a subgroup of brain injury patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage shows a beneficial effect, though the increase in adverse reactions suffered by the intervention group may mean that the drug is harmful for some patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009803.pub2	We included four RCTs with a total of 3090 enrolled participants (one study used a cluster-randomized design).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009803.pub2	Three trials were considered to have a relatively low risk of bias, and one trial was considered to have a relatively high risk.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009803.pub2	When survival to hospital discharge was compared, 38 of 320 (11.88%) participants survived to discharge in the initial CPR plus delayed defibrillation group compared with 39 of 338 participants (11.54%) in the immediate defibrillation group (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.20, Chi2 = 10.78, degrees of freedom (df) = 5, P value 0.06, I2 = 54%, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009803.pub2	When we compared the neurological outcome at hospital discharge (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.93, low-quality evidence), the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.15,low-quality evidence) and survival at one year (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.49, low-quality evidence), we could not rule out the superiority of either treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009803.pub2	Adverse effects were not associated with either treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009803.pub2	Owing to the low quality of available evidence, we have been unable to determine conclusively whether immediate defibrillation and one and one-half to three minutes of CPR as initial therapy before defibrillation have similar effects on rates of return of spontaneous circulation, survival to discharge or neurological insult.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009803.pub2	We have also been unable to conclude whether either treatment approach provides a degree of superiority in OHCA.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009803.pub2	We propose that this is an area that needs further rigorous research through additional high-quality RCTs, including larger sample sizes and proper subgroup analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004379.pub3	The new search identified fifteen trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004379.pub3	Three trials were eligible for inclusion.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004379.pub3	Ten trials involving eight different comparison groups have been included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004379.pub3	Only one trial reported live birth rates.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004379.pub3	The number of oocytes retrieved were significantly less in the conventional GnRHa long protocol compared to stop protocol and GnRH antagonist protocol.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004379.pub3	Total dose of gonadotrophins used was significantly higher in the GnRHa long protocol group compared to the Stop protocol and GnRH antagonist groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004379.pub3	Cancellation rates were significantly higher in the GnRHa flare up group compared to the GnRHa long protocol group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004379.pub3	None of the studies reported a difference in the miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy rates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004379.pub3	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of any particular intervention either for pituitary down regulation, ovarian stimulation or adjuvant therapy in the management of poor responders to controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004379.pub3	More robust data from good quality RCTs with relevant outcomes are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000088.pub3	This 2009-10 update adds 21 additional studies, with a total of 53 randomised controlled trials included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000088.pub3	Family intervention may decrease the frequency of relapse (n = 2981, 32 RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.5 to 0.6, NNT 7 CI 6 to 8), although some small but negative studies might not have been identified by the search.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000088.pub3	Family intervention may also reduce hospital admission (n = 481, 8 RCTs, RR 0.78 CI 0.6 to 1.0, NNT 8 CI 6 to 13) and encourage compliance with medication (n = 695, 10 RCTs, RR 0.60 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 6 CI 5 to 9) but it does not obviously affect the tendency of individuals/families to leave care (n = 733, 10 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.5 to 1.0).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000088.pub3	Family intervention also seems to improve general social impairment and the levels of expressed emotion within the family.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000088.pub3	We did not find data to suggest that family intervention either prevents or promotes suicide.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000088.pub3	Family intervention may reduce the number of relapse events and hospitalisations and would therefore be of interest to people with schizophrenia, clinicians and policy makers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000088.pub3	However, the treatment effects of these trials may be overestimated due to the poor methodological quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000088.pub3	Further data from trials that describe the methods of randomisation, test the blindness of the study evaluators, and implement the CONSORT guidelines would enable greater confidence in these findings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Three trials that randomized a combined total of 263 participants met the review inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	All three trials examined the treatment of symptomatic in-stent restenosis within the femoropopliteal arteries.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	These trials were carried out in Germany and Austria and used paclitaxel as the agent in the drug-eluting balloons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Two of the three trials were industry sponsored.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Two companies manufactured the drug-eluting balloons (Eurocor, Bonn, Germany; Medtronic, Fridley, Minnesota, USA).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	The trials examined both anatomical and clinical endpoints.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	We noted heterogeneity in the frequency of bailout stenting deployment between studies as well as in the dosage of paclitaxel applied by the DEBs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Using GRADE assessment criteria, we determined that the certainty of evidence presented was very low for the outcomes of amputation, target lesion revascularization, binary restenosis, death, and improvement of one or more Rutherford categories.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Most participants were followed up to 12 months, but one trial followed participants for up to 24 months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Trial results show no difference in the incidence of amputation between DEBs and uncoated balloon angioplasty.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	DEBs showed better outcomes for up to 24 months for target lesion revascularization (odds ratio (OR) 0.05, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.92 at six months; OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.70 at 24 months) and at six and 12 months for binary restenosis (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.56 at six months; OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.76 at 12 months).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Participants treated with DEBs also showed improvement of one or more Rutherford categories at six and 12 months (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.21 at six months; OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.83 at 12 months).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Data show no clear differences in death between DEBs and uncoated balloon angioplasty.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Data were insufficient for subgroup or sensitivity analyses to be conducted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Based on a meta-analysis of three trials with 263 participants, evidence suggests an advantage for DEBs compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty for anatomical endpoints such as target lesion revascularization (TLR) and binary restenosis, and for one clinical endpoint - improvement in Rutherford category post intervention for up to 24 months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	However, the certainty of evidence for all these outcomes is very low due to the small number of included studies and participants and the high risk of bias in study design.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2	Adequately powered and carefully constructed randomized controlled trials are needed to adequately investigate the role of drug-eluting technologies in the management of in-stent restenosis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Seven trials consisting of 922 participants were included in this analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Trials ranged from 32 to 242 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	On pooled analysis, corticosteroids reduced the subsequent occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities (odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.46; 907 participants; 7 studies; I² = 55%) without resultant serious adverse events (no events, 737 participants) and mortality (no events, 915 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	In addition, corticosteroids reduced the duration of fever (mean difference (MD) −1.65 days, 95% CI −3.31 to 0.00; 210 participants; 2 studies; I² = 88%), time for laboratory parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)) to normalise (MD −2.80 days, 95% CI −4.38 to −1.22; 178 participants; 1 study) and length of hospital stay (MD −1.41 days, 95% CI −2.36 to −0.46; 39 participants; 1 study).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	No studies detailed outcomes beyond 24 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Subgroup analysis showed some potential groups that may benefit more than others; however, further randomised controlled trials are required before this can be the basis for clinical action.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Evidence quality was graded according to the GRADE system.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Evidence was considered high quality for the incidence of serious adverse events, mortality and time for laboratory parameters to normalise.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Evidence was considered moderate for the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities due to potential inconsistencies in data geography and patient benefits according to grouping.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Evidence was moderate for duration of clinical symptoms (fever, rash) due to potential subjectivity in measurement.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Evidence was moderate for length of hospital stay as only one study recorded this outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	This means that we are reasonably confident that the true effect is close to that estimated in this work.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Moderate-quality evidence shows that use of steroids in the acute phase of KD can be associated with improved coronary artery abnormalities, shorter duration of hospital stay and a decreased duration of clinical symptoms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	High-quality evidence shows reduced inflammatory marker levels.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	There were insufficient data available regarding incidence of adverse effects attributable to steroids, mortality and long-term (> 1 year) coronary morbidity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Certain groups, including those based in Asia, those with higher risk scores, and those receiving longer steroid treatment may have greater benefit from steroid use, especially with decreasing rates of heart problems, but more tests are needed to answer these questions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011188.pub2	Evidence presented in this study suggests that treatment with a long course of steroids should be considered for all children diagnosed with KD until further studies are performed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	We included eight studies comprising 846 randomised participants, of which four studies involved comparisons of PIP with control groups only.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Four studies involved comparisons with another treatment group (i.e. another PIP, video-interaction guidance, psychoeducation, counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), two of these studies included a control group in addition to an alternative treatment group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Samples included women with postpartum depression, anxious or insecure attachment, maltreated, and prison populations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	We assessed potential bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, and other bias).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Four studies were at low risk of bias in four or more domains.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Four studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment, and no study blinded participants or personnel to the intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Five studies did not provide adequate information for assessment of risk of bias in at least one domain (rated as unclear).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Six studies contributed data to the PIP versus control comparisons producing 19 meta-analyses of outcomes measured at post-intervention or follow-up, or both, for the primary outcomes of parental depression (both dichotomous and continuous data); measures of parent-child interaction (i.e. maternal sensitivity, child involvement and parent engagement; infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, disorganised, resistant); attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and secondary outcomes (e.g. infant cognitive development).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	The results favoured neither PIP nor control for incidence of parental depression (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.04, 3 studies, 278 participants, low quality evidence) or parent-reported levels of depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.02, 4 studies, 356 participants, low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	There were improvements favouring PIP in the proportion of infants securely attached at post-intervention (RR 8.93, 95% CI 1.25 to 63.70, 2 studies, 168 participants, very low quality evidence); a reduction in the number of infants with an avoidant attachment style at post-intervention (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.95, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); fewer infants with disorganised attachment at post-intervention (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.58, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); and an increase in the proportion of infants moving from insecure to secure attachment at post-intervention (RR 11.45, 95% CI 3.11 to 42.08, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	There were no differences between PIP and control in any of the meta-analyses for the remaining primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Four studies contributed data at post-intervention or follow-up to the PIP versus alternative treatment analyses producing 15 meta-analyses measuring parent mental health (depression); parent-infant interaction (maternal sensitivity); infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, resistant, disorganised) and attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and infant cognitive development.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	None of the remaining meta-analyses of PIP versus alternative treatment for primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes showed differences in outcome or any adverse changes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	For all comparisons, we rated the evidence as low or very low quality for parental depression and secure or disorganised infant attachment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Where we downgraded the evidence, it was because there was risk of bias in the study design or execution of the trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	The included studies also involved relatively few participants and wide CI values (imprecision), and, in some cases, we detected clinical and statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Although the findings of the current review suggest that PIP is a promising model in terms of improving infant attachment security in high-risk families, there were no significant differences compared with no treatment or treatment-as-usual for other parent-based or relationship-based outcomes, and no evidence that PIP is more effective than other methods of working with parents and infants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010534.pub2	Further rigorous research is needed to establish the impact of PIP on potentially important mediating factors such as parental mental health, reflective functioning, and parent-infant interaction.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006161.pub3	We found one new included study in this updated version.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006161.pub3	In total, our updated review includes 11 trials (with 753 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006161.pub3	The low quality of evidence showed no significant differences in average Apgar scores at one minute (N = six trials, 519 participants; 95% confidence (CI) -0.16 to 0.31, P = 0.53) and at five minutes (N = six trials, 519 participants; 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06, P = 0.98).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006161.pub3	None of the 11 trials reported maternal desaturation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006161.pub3	The very low quality of evidence showed that in comparison to room air, women in labour receiving supplementary oxygen had higher maternal oxygen saturation (N = three trials, 209 participants), maternal PaO2 (oxygen pressure in the blood; N = six trials, 241 participants), UaPO2 (foetal umbilical arterial blood; N = eight trials, 504 participants; 95% CI 1.8 to 4.9, P < 0.0001) and UvPO2 (foetal umbilical venous blood; N = 10 trials, 683 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006161.pub3	There was high heterogeneity among these outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006161.pub3	A subgroup analysis showed no significant difference in UaPO2 between the two intervention groups in low-risk studies, whereas the high-risk studies showed a benefit for the neonatal oxygen group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006161.pub3	Overall, we found no convincing evidence that giving supplementary oxygen to healthy term pregnant women during elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia is either beneficial or harmful for either the mother or the foetus' short-term clinical outcome as assessed by Apgar scores.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006161.pub3	Although, there were significant higher maternal and neonatal blood gas values and markers of free radicals when extra oxygen was given, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the low grade quality of the evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	We included twelve studies containing data on 2196 participants; four of these studies were newly included in this 2011 update of our 2006 Cochrane review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	Six intervention groups in four trials provided data on the percentage of pills taken.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	Reminder packaging increased the percentage of pills taken (mean difference (MD) 11% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6% to 17%)).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	Notable heterogeneity occurred among these trials (I2 = 96.3%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	Two trials provided data for the proportion of self-reported adherent patients, reporting a reduction in the intervention group which was not statistically significant (odds ratio = 0.89 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.40)).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	We conducted meta-analysis on data from two trials assessing the effect of reminder packaging on blood pressure measurements.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	We found that reminder packaging significantly decreased diastolic blood pressure (MD = -5.89 mmHg (95% CI -6.70 to -5.09; P < 0.00001; I2 = 0%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	No effect was seen on systolic blood pressure (mean change -1.01, 95% CI -2.22 to 0.20; P = 0.1, I2 = 0%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	We also conducted meta-analysis on extracted data from two trials that looked at change in glycated haemoglobin.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	We found that reminder packaging significantly reduced glycated haemoglobin levels (MD -0.72; 95% CI -0.83 to -0.60; P < 0.00001; I2 = 92%), although there was considerable heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	No appropriate data were available for meta-analysis of remaining clinical outcomes, which included serum vitamin C and E levels, and self-reported psychological symptoms (one trial each).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	We reported remaining data narratively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	In one study the presence of a reminder packaging aid was found to be preferred by patients with low literacy levels.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	Reminder packing may represent a simple method for improving adherence for patients with selected conditions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3	Further research is warranted to improve the design and targeting of these devices.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007472.pub2	We identified a total of 15 randomised trials evaluating 11 different pharmacological interventions (methylprednisolone, multivitamin antioxidant infusion, vitamin E infusion, amrinone, prostaglandin E1, pentoxifylline, mannitol, trimetazidine, dextrose, allopurinol, and OKY 046 (a thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor)).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007472.pub2	All trials had high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007472.pub2	There were no significant differences between the groups in mortality, liver failure, or perioperative morbidity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007472.pub2	The trimetazidine group had a significantly shorter hospital stay than control (MD -3.00 days; 95% CI -3.57 to -2.43).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007472.pub2	There were no significant differences in any of the clinically relevant outcomes in the remaining comparisons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007472.pub2	Methylprednisolone improved the enzyme markers of liver function and trimetazidine, methylprednisolone, and dextrose reduced the enzyme markers of liver injury compared with controls.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007472.pub2	However, there is a high risk of type I and type II errors because of the few trials included, the small sample size in each trial, and the risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007472.pub2	Trimetazidine, methylprednisolone, and dextrose may protect against ischaemia reperfusion injury in elective liver resections performed under vascular occlusion, but this is shown in trials with small sample sizes and high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007472.pub2	The use of these drugs should be restricted to well-designed randomised clinical trials before implementing them in clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Apart from the remaining 37 studies included from the original review, the search resulted in the inclusion of 24 new studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	In total, we included 61 studies; 46 for prevalence, six for both prevalence and risk factors, and nine not meeting the inclusion criteria, but assessing risk factors.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	The 52 studies evaluating the prevalence of renal dysfunction included 13,327 participants of interest, of whom at least 4499 underwent renal function testing.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	The prevalence of adverse renal effects ranged from 0% to 84%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	This variation may be due to diversity of included malignancies, received treatments, reported outcome measures, follow-up duration and the methodological quality of available evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Seven out of 52 studies, including 244 participants, reported the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which ranged from 2.4% to 32%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Of these 52 studies, 36 studied a decreased (estimated) GFR, including at least 432 CCS, and found it was present in 0% to 73.7% of participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	One eligible study reported an increased risk of glomerular dysfunction after concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides and vancomycin in CCS receiving total body irradiation (TBI).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Four non-eligible studies assessing a total cohort of CCS, found nephrectomy and (high-dose (HD)) ifosfamide as risk factors for decreased GFR.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	The majority also reported cisplatin as a risk factor.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	In addition, two non-eligible studies showed an association of a longer follow-up period with glomerular dysfunction.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Twenty-two out of 52 studies, including 851 participants, studied proteinuria, which was present in 3.5% to 84% of participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Risk factors, analysed by three non-eligible studies, included HD cisplatin, (HD) ifosfamide, TBI, and a combination of nephrectomy and abdominal radiotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	However, studies were contradictory and incomparable.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Eleven out of 52 studies assessed hypophosphataemia or tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR), or both.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Prevalence ranged between 0% and 36.8% for hypophosphataemia in 287 participants, and from 0% to 62.5% for impaired TPR in 246 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	One non-eligible study investigated risk factors for hypophosphataemia, but could not find any association.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Four out of 52 studies, including 128 CCS, assessed the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia, which ranged between 13.2% and 28.6%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Both non-eligible studies investigating risk factors identified cisplatin as a risk factor.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Carboplatin, nephrectomy and follow-up time were other reported risk factors.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	The prevalence of hypertension ranged from 0% to 50% in 2464 participants (30/52 studies).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Risk factors reported by one eligible study were older age at screening and abdominal radiotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	A non-eligible study also found long follow-up time as risk factor.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Three non-eligible studies showed that a higher body mass index increased the risk of hypertension.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Treatment-related risk factors were abdominal radiotherapy and TBI, but studies were inconsistent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Because of the profound heterogeneity of the studies, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Risk of bias was present in all studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	The prevalence of adverse renal effects after treatment with cisplatin, carboplatin, ifosfamide, radiation therapy involving the kidney region, nephrectomy, or any combination of these, ranged from 0% to 84% depending on the study population, received treatment combination, reported outcome measure, follow-up duration and methodological quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	With currently available evidence, it was not possible to draw solid conclusions regarding the prevalence of, and treatment-related risk factors for, specific adverse renal effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Future studies should focus on adequate study designs and reporting, including large prospective cohort studies with adequate control groups when possible.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	In addition, these studies should deploy multivariable risk factor analyses to correct for possible confounding.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Next to research concerning known nephrotoxic therapies, exploring nephrotoxicity after new therapeutic agents is advised for future studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008944.pub3	Until more evidence becomes available, CCS should preferably be enrolled into long-term follow-up programmes to monitor their renal function and blood pressure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub6	Two trials (182 participants) and two phytomedicines Niprisan® (also known as Nicosan®) and Ciklavit® were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub6	The Phase IIB (pivotal) trial suggests that Niprisan® was effective in reducing episodes of severe painful sickle cell disease crisis over a six-month period (low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub6	It did not affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub6	No serious adverse effects were reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub6	The single trial of Cajanus cajan (Ciklavit®) reported a possible benefit to individuals with painful crises (low-quality evidence), and a possible adverse effect (non-significant) on the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub6	While Niprisan® appeared to be safe and effective in reducing severe painful crises over a six-month follow-up period, further trials are required to assess its role in the management of people with sickle cell disease and the results of its multicentre trials are awaited.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub6	Currently no conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit®.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub6	Based on the published results for Niprisan® and in view of the limitations in data collection and analysis of both trials, phytomedicines may have a potential beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in sickle cell disease.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub6	This needs to be further validated in future trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub6	More trials are required on the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines used in managing sickle cell disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	Our search strategies led to 308 potentially relevant references.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	From these, we included three studies involving 1999 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	We judged the overall potential risk of bias as moderate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	The studies were reported as RCTs; blinding was not reported, but given the study design it is likely that there was no blinding.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	One study was published in abstract form only; hence, detailed assessment of the risk of bias was not possible.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	Two trials compared standard treatment (chemotherapy plus radiotherapy) with PET-adapted therapy (chemotherapy only) in individuals with early-stage HL and negative PET scans.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	The study design of the third trial was more complex.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	Participants with early-stage HL were divided into those with a favourable or unfavourable prognosis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	They were then randomised to receive PET-adapted or standard treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	Following a PET scan, participants were further divided into PET-positive and PET-negative groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	To date, data have been published for the PET-negative arms only, making it possible to perform a meta-analysis including all three trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	Of the 1999 participants included in the three trials only 1480 were analysed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	The 519 excluded participants were either PET-positive, or were excluded because they did not match the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	One study reported no deaths.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	The other two studies reported two deaths in participants receiving PET-adapted therapy and two in participants receiving standard therapy (very-low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	Progression-free survival was shorter in participants with PET-adapted therapy (without radiotherapy) than in those receiving standard treatment with radiotherapy (HR 2.38; 95% CI 1.62 to 3.50; P value < 0.0001).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	This difference was also apparent in comparisons of participants receiving no additional radiotherapy (PET-adapted therapy) versus radiotherapy (standard therapy) (HR 1.86; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.23; P value = 0.03) and in those receiving chemotherapy but no radiotherapy (PET-adapted therapy) versus standard radiotherapy (HR 3.00; 95% CI 1.75 to 5.14; P value < 0.0001) (moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	Short-term AEs only were assessed in one trial, which showed no evidence of a difference between the treatment arms (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.53; P value = 0.72) (very-low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	No data on long-term AEs were reported in any of the trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	To date, no robust data on OS, response rate, TRM, QoL, or short- and long-term AEs are available.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	However, this systematic review found moderate-quality evidence that PFS was shorter in individuals with early-stage HL and a negative PET scan receiving chemotherapy only (PET-adapted therapy) than in those receiving additional radiotherapy (standard therapy).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	More RCTs with longer follow ups may lead to more precise results for AEs, TRM and QoL, and could evaluate whether this PFS advantage will translate into an overall survival benefit.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010533.pub2	It is still uncertain whether PET-positive individuals benefit from PET-based treatment adaptation and the effect of such an approach in those with advanced HL.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	No new trials were eligible in 2014.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	None included a placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from levonorgestrel COCs were inconsistent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the levonorgestrel-COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a levonorgestrel-COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	In an injectable study, a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting insulin (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17β-estradiol had lower means than the levonorgestrel group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	In a small trial using two levonorgestrel COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal weight women did not differ significantly.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006133.pub5	Only one small trial stratified the groups by body mass index (obese versus normal).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	We considered that seven of the 10 included RCTs had a low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	However, the results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias as none of the RCTs were able to blind participants to treatment allocation and, while most RCTs reported blinded outcome assessment, pain, physical function and quality of life were participant self reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	One of the 10 RCTs was only reported as a conference abstract and did not provide sufficient data for the evaluation of bias risk.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	High-quality evidence from nine trials (549 participants) indicated that exercise reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.55 to -0.20) and improved physical function (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.05) immediately after treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	Pain and physical function were estimated to be 29 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (0 was no pain or loss of physical function) in the control group; exercise reduced pain by an equivalent of 8 points (95% CI 4 to 11 points; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and improved physical function by an equivalent of 7 points (95% CI 1 to 12 points; NNTB 6).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	Only three small studies (183 participants) evaluated quality of life, with overall low quality evidence, with no benefit of exercise demonstrated (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.36).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	Quality of life was estimated to be 50 points on a norm-based mean (standard deviation (SD)) score of 50 (10) in the general population in the control group; exercise improved quality of life by 0 points.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	Moderate-quality evidence from seven trials (715 participants) indicated an increased likelihood of withdrawal from the exercise allocation (event rate 6%) compared with the control group (event rate 3%), but this difference was not significant (risk difference 1%; 95% CI -1% to 4%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	Of the five studies reporting adverse events, each study reported only one or two events and all were related to increased pain attributed to the exercise programme.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	The reduction in pain was sustained at least three to six months after ceasing monitored treatment (five RCTs, 391 participants): pain (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.18).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	Pain was estimated to be 29 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (0 was no pain) in the control group, the improvement in pain translated to a sustained reduction in pain intensity of 8 points (95% CI 4 to 12 points) compared with the control group (0 to 100 scale).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	The improvement in physical function was also sustained (five RCTs, 367 participants): physical function (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.16).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	Physical function was estimated to be 24 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (0 was no loss of physical function) in the control group, the improvement translated to a mean of 7 points (95% CI 4 to 13) compared with the control group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	Only five of the 10 RCTs exclusively recruited people with symptomatic hip OA (419 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	There was no significant difference in pain or physical function outcomes compared with five studies recruiting participants with hip or knee OA (130 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007912.pub2	Pooling the results of these 10 RCTs demonstrated that land-based therapeutic exercise programmes can reduce pain and improve physical function among people with symptomatic hip OA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2	Nine high-methodological-quality RCTs(260 participants) met the inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2	Six trials focussed on comparison of exercise therapy versus no exercise therapy, whereas three trials compared two interventions that both met our definition of exercise therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2	Best evidence synthesis showed strong evidence in favour of exercise therapy compared to no exercise therapy in terms of muscle power function, exercise tolerance functions and mobility-related activities.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2	Moderate evidence was found for improving mood.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2	No evidence was observed for exercise therapy on fatigue and perception of handicap when compared to no exercise therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2	Finally, no evidence was found that specific exercise therapy programmes were more successful in improving activities and participation than other exercise treatments.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2	No evidence of deleterious effects of exercise therapy was described in included studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2	The results of the present review suggest that exercise therapy can be beneficial for patients with MS not experiencing an exacerbation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2	There is an urgent need for consensus on a core set of outcome measures to be used in exercise trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2	In addition, these studies should experimentally control for 'dose' of treatment, type of MS and should include sufficient contrast between experimental and control groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	Only one trial including 75 participants (average age: 43 years; females: 65% of participants), randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis) (n = 35) or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting period of 4.2 months) (n = 40), contributed information to this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	The trial had a high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	Information on the outcome mortality was available for the 75 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	Information on serious adverse events was available for 68 participants (28 people in the early group and 40 people in the delayed group).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	The other outcomes were available for 28 participants in the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group and 35 participants in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	There were no deaths in the early group (0/35) (0%) versus 1/40 (2.5%) in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (P > 0.9999).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	There was no bile duct injury in either group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	There were no serious adverse events related to the surgery in either group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	During the waiting period, complications developed in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	The complications that the participants suffered included pancreatitis (n = 1), empyema of the gallbladder (n = 1), gallbladder perforation (n = 1), acute cholecystitis (n = 2), cholangitis (n = 2), obstructive jaundice (n = 2), and recurrent biliary colic (requiring hospital visits) (n = 5).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	In total, 14 participants required hospital admissions for the above symptoms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	All of these admissions occurred in the delayed group as all the participants were operated on within 24 hours in the early group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	The proportion of people who developed serious adverse events was 0/28 (0%) in the early group, which was significantly lower than in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group 9/40 (22.5%) (P = 0.0082).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	This trial did not report quality of life or return to work.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy in the early group 0/28 (0%) compared with the delayed group (6/35 or 17.1%) (P = 0.0743).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	There was a statistically significant shorter hospital stay in the early group than in the delayed group (MD -1.25 days, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.45).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	There was a statistically significant shorter operating time in the early group than the delayed group (MD -14.80 minutes, 95% CI -18.02 to -11.58).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	Based on evidence from only one high-bias risk trial, it appears that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis of biliary colic) decreases the morbidity during the waiting period for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting time 4.2 months), the hospital stay, and operating time.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007196.pub3	Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to confirm or refute these findings, and to determine if early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is better than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy if the waiting time is shortened further.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010266.pub2	A total of 11 trials were included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010266.pub2	Most of the studies had an unclear risk of bias prompting us to downgrade the quality of evidence for our outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010266.pub2	Seven of these trials provided evidence for the main comparison and the primary outcome and these were pooled.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010266.pub2	Overall, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduces the risk of SSI (plausible effects range between a 76% to a 0.26% relative reduction in SSI with long-term antibiotic prophylaxis) (472 participants; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.74; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010266.pub2	There is uncertainty surrounding the relative effects of short-term antibiotics compared with a single dose (220 participants; RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.22; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010266.pub2	No reports described adverse effects associated with the drugs in those trials that reported in this outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010266.pub2	None of these trials assessed or reported data regarding other outcomes, and information was insufficient to show whether a specific antibiotic is better than another.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010266.pub2	For people undergoing orthognathic surgery, long term antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the risk of SSI compared with short-term antibiotic prophylaxis and the is uncertainty of whether short-term antibiotic prophylaxis decreases SSi risk relative to a single pre-operative dose of prophylactic antibiotics.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	We included one study, involving 40 infants and 42 women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	The trial was underpowered to detect clinically important outcome differences between the two policies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	There were no significant benefits or adverse effects of elective preterm birth at 36 weeks' gestation for fetal gastroschisis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	The primary outcomes were caesarean section and neonatal survival to discharge.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	Two babies died after birth but before discharge in the elective (intervention) group versus none in the spontaneous group (risk ratio (RR) 5.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 98.00; one study, n = 40).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	Seven women (33%) in the elective group and nine women (43%) in the spontaneous group delivered by caesarean section (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.70).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	Similarly, for the secondary outcomes, there were no statistical differences in birthweight, ventilation requirements, necrotising enterocolitis and requirement for repeat surgery between the two groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	None of our prespecified maternal secondary outcomes were reported in the included study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	We also examined gestational age at birth as a non-prespecified outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	There was a difference in gestational age at birth between the two arms of the trial (35.8 weeks (SD 0.7) in the elective group and 36.7 (SD 1.5) in the spontaneous group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	Possible reasons for this small mean difference include a trend towards spontaneous preterm birth in pregnancies complicated by fetal gastroschisis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	This review is unable to draw any firm conclusions regarding preterm birth for infants with gastroschisis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	It is not possible to say whether the intervention is beneficial or harmful for these babies or their mothers.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	Only one small trial is included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009394.pub2	Further research is needed in this area.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	Three studies in adults satisfied the inclusion criteria, lasting up to one week; 122 participants were randomised initially, and 95 completed treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	We found no studies in children.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	One study was parallel-group, and two had a cross-over design.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	All used paracetamol as an add-on to established treatment with strong opioids (median daily morphine equivalent doses of 60 mg, 70 mg, and 225 mg, with some participants taking several hundred mg of oral morphine equivalents daily).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	Other non-paracetamol medication included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tricyclic antidepressants, or neuroleptics.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	All studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and small size; none was unequivocally at low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	None of the studies reported any of our primary outcomes: participants with pain reduction of at least 50%, and at least 30%, from baseline; participants with pain no worse than mild at the end of the treatment period; participants with Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved (or equivalent wording).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	What pain reports there were indicated no difference between paracetamol and placebo when added to another treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	There was no convincing evidence of paracetamol being different from placebo with regards to quality of life, use of rescue medication, or participant satisfaction or preference.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	Measures of harm (serious adverse events, other adverse events, and withdrawal due to lack of efficacy) were inconsistently reported and provided no clear evidence of difference.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	Our GRADE assessment of evidence quality was very low for all outcomes, because studies were at high risk of bias from several sources.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	There is no high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of paracetamol alone or in combination with opioids for the first two steps of the three-step WHO cancer pain ladder.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012637.pub2	It is not clear whether any additional analgesic benefit of paracetamol could be detected in the available studies, in view of the doses of opioids used.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	Of the 15 trials identified, 14 were conducted in China and 14 in hospitals.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	The quality of reporting was poor with no studies clearly describing allocation concealment and much data were missing or unusable.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	All results are vulnerable to considerable bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	Most frequently the primary outcome was the diameter of the wet patch on the pillow.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	Antimuscarinics (astemizole, diphenhydramine, propantheline, doxepin) were the most commonly evaluated drugs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	For the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement' astemizole and diphenhydramine were more effective than placebo (astemizole: n=97, 2 RCTs, RR 0.61 CI 0.47 to 0.81 NNT 3 CI 2 to 5; diphenhydramine: n=131, 2 RCTs, RR 0.43 CI 0.31 to 0.58, NNT 2 CI 1.5 to 2.5), but the doses of astemizole used were those that can cause toxicity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	Data involving propantheline were heterogeneous (I2= 86.6%), but both studies showed benefit over placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	Adverse effects were poorly recorded.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	Of the other interventions, oryzanol (rice bran oil and rice embryo oil extract) showed benefit over the antimuscarinic doxepin in terms of 'no clinically important change' (n=104, 1 RCT, RR 0.45 CI 0.27 to 0.75, NNT 4 CI 2 to 7).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	The Chinese medicine suo quo wan (comprises spicebush root, Chinese yam and bitter cardamom) showed benefit over doxepin (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 'no clinically important change' 0.31 CI 0.16 to 0.59, NNT 3 CI 1.5 to 3.7).	1

10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2	Current practice outside of well designed randomised trials should be clearly justified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	We included six RCTs, comprising 195 participants with MS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	Two RCTs investigated inspiratory muscle training with a threshold device; three RCTs, expiratory muscle training with a threshold device; and one RCT, regular breathing exercises.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	Eighteen participants (˜ 10%) dropped out; trials reported no serious adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	We pooled and analyzed data of 5 trials (N=137) for both inspiratory and expiratory muscle training, using a fixed-effect model for all but one outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	Compared to no active control, meta-analysis showed that inspiratory muscle training resulted in no significant difference in maximal inspiratory pressure (mean difference (MD) 6.50 cmH2O, 95% confidence interval (CI) −7.39 to 20.38, P = 0.36, I2 = 0%) or maximal expiratory pressure (MD −8.22 cmH2O, 95% CI −26.20 to 9.77, P = 0.37, I2 = 0%), but there was a significant benefit on the predicted maximal inspiratory pressure (MD 20.92 cmH2O, 95% CI 6.03 to 35.81, P = 0.006, I2 = 18%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	Meta-analysis with a random-effects model failed to show a significant difference in predicted maximal expiratory pressure (MD 5.86 cmH2O, 95% CI −10.63 to 22.35, P = 0.49, I2 = 55%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	These studies did not report outcomes for health-related quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	Three RCTS compared expiratory muscle training versus no active control or sham training.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	Under a fixed-effect model, meta-analysis failed to show a significant difference between groups with regard to maximal expiratory pressure (MD 8.33 cmH2O, 95% CI −0.93 to 17.59, P = 0.18, I2 = 42%) or maximal inspiratory pressure (MD 3.54 cmH2O, 95% CI −5.04 to 12.12, P = 0.42, I2 = 41%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	One trial assessed quality of life, finding no differences between groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	For all predetermined secondary outcomes, such as forced expiratory volume, forced vital capacity and peak flow pooling was not possible.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	However, two trials on inspiratory muscle training assessed fatigue using the Fatigue Severity Scale (range of scores 0-56 ), finding no difference between groups (MD, −0.28 points, 95% CI−0.95 to 0.39, P = 0.42, I2 = 0%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	Due to the low number of studies included, we could not perform cumulative meta-analysis or subgroup analyses.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	It was not possible to perform a meta-analysis for adverse events, no serious adverse were mentioned in any of the included trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	The quality of evidence was low for all outcomes because of limitations in design and implementation as well as imprecision of results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	This review provides low-quality evidence that resistive inspiratory muscle training with a resistive threshold device is moderately effective postintervention for improving predicted maximal inspiratory pressure in people with mild to moderate MS, whereas expiratory muscle training showed no significant effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009424.pub2	The sustainability of the favourable effect of inspiratory muscle training is unclear, as is the impact of the observed effects on quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007722.pub2	This review included one RCT in which 38 women (41 pregnancies) were randomised, with only 26 women (28 pregnancies) being analysed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007722.pub2	This RCT comparing the effect of betamethasone (1.5 mg/day) with no medication found no statistically significant difference in neonatal thrombocytopenia (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 2.05) and neonatal bleeding (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.13).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007722.pub2	Review authors conducted an intention-to-treat analysis which showed similar findings: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.45 and RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.61, respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007722.pub2	Maternal death, perinatal mortality, postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal intracranial haemorrhage were not studied by this RCT.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007722.pub2	Current evidence indicates that compared to no medication, betamethasone did not reduce the risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia and neonatal bleeding in ITP during pregnancy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007722.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of betamethasone for treating ITP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007722.pub2	This Cohrane review does not provide evidence about other medical treatments for ITP during pregnancy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007722.pub2	This systematic review also identifies the need for well-designed, adequately powered randomised clinical trials for this medical condition during pregnancy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007722.pub2	Unless randomised clinical trials provide evidence of a treatment effect and the trade off between potential benefits and harms are established, policy-makers, clinicians, and academics should not use betamethasone for ITP in pregnant women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007722.pub2	Any future trials on medical treatments for treating ITP during pregnancy should test a variety of important maternal, neonatal or both outcome measures, including maternal death, perinatal mortality, postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal intracranial haemorrhage.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	We identified two completed studies, with a total of 111 participants (n = 30 and n = 81), both conducted in Iran, that met our inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Participants had moderate to severe keratoconus pre-operatively and were randomly allocated to receive either DALK or penetrating keratoplasty.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Only one eye of each participant was treated as part of the trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	The smaller study had 12 month follow-up data for all participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	For the larger study, four DALK surgeries had to be abandoned due to technical failure and visual and refractive outcomes were not measured in these participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Follow-up length for the remaining 77 participants ranged from 6.8 to 36.4 months, with all 77 followed for at least three months post-suture removal.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Details of the randomisation procedure were unavailable for the smaller study and so sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine if the results from this study had affected the overall results of the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Neither of the included studies reported a difference between groups on any of the measures of post-graft visual achievement, keratometric astigmatism or spherical equivalent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	A single case of graft failure in a penetrating keratoplasty was reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	No postoperative graft failures were reported in the DALK group of either study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Instances of graft rejection were reported in both groups, in both studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	The majority of these cases were successfully treated with steroids.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	The data, which related to all cases in each study - given that the four cases that did not go ahead as planned had already technically failed without presence of rejection - showed that rejection was less likely to occur in DALK (odds ratio (OR): 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.81, GRADE rating: moderate).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that inclusion of the Razmju 2011 study did not bias the results with regards to rejection episodes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	While sensitivity analysis showed altered results with regards to failure rates, the data available from the Javadi 2010 study alone had a very wide 95% CI, suggesting an imprecise estimate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Therefore, even after removal of the Razmju 2011 data, it is still difficult to draw conclusions regarding superiority of one technique over another with regards to graft failure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	DALK was unable to be completed as planned in four cases and in a further three cases, complications during dissection required further intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Other adverse events, of varying severity, were reported in both intervention groups with similar frequency.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	For both types of surgery, these included postoperative astigmatism, steroid induced ocular hypertension and persistent epithelial defects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	In recipients of DALK, one participant had interface neovascularisation (a proliferation of blood vessels where the host and donor cornea come together) and one had wrinkling of Descemet's membrane, the basement membrane separating the corneal stroma from the corneal endothelium.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	In the penetrating keratoplasty groups, one participant required graft resuturing and one had an atonic pupil, a condition in which the pupil dilates and is non-reactive.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low to moderate, with methodological limitations, incomplete data analysis and imprecision of findings, as well as high risk of bias in several areas for both studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	We found no evidence to support a difference in outcomes with regards to BCVA at three months post-graft or at any of the other time points analysed (GRADE rating: very low).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	We also found no evidence of a difference in outcomes with regards to graft survival, final UCVA or keratometric outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	We found some evidence that rejection is more likely to occur following penetrating keratoplasty than DALK (GRADE rating: moderate).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	The small number of studies included in the review and methodological issues relating to the two, mean that the overall quality of the evidence in this review is low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	There is currently insufficient evidence to determine which technique may offer better overall outcomes - final visual acuity and time to attain this, keratometric stabilisation, risk of rejection or failure, or both, and risk of other adverse events - for patients with keratoconus.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009700.pub2	Large randomised trials comparing the outcomes of penetrating keratoplasty and DALK in the treatment of keratoconus are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	The search strategy identified 31,767 records; after screening, 90 full-text reports were assessed for eligibility.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	We included 67 trials (from 76 reports), recruiting 8506 women; the number of women included in analyses varied greatly between outcomes, with endpoint haemoglobin concentration being the outcome with the largest number of participants analysed (6861 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Only 10 studies were considered at low overall risk of bias, with most studies presenting insufficient details about trial quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Women receiving iron were significantly less likely to be anaemic at the end of intervention compared to women receiving control (risk ratio (RR) 0.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.60, 10 studies, 3273 women, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Women receiving iron had a higher haemoglobin concentration at the end of intervention compared to women receiving control (mean difference (MD) 5.30, 95% CI 4.14 to 6.45, 51 studies, 6861 women, high quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Women receiving iron had a reduced risk of iron deficiency compared to women receiving control (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.76, 7 studies, 1088 women, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Only one study (55 women) specifically reported iron-deficiency anaemia and no studies reported mortality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Seven trials recruiting 901 women reported on 'any side effect' and did not identify an overall increased prevalence of side effects from iron supplements (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.86, low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Five studies recruiting 521 women identified an increased prevalence of gastrointestinal side effects in women taking iron (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.12, low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Six studies recruiting 604 women identified an increased prevalence of loose stools/diarrhoea (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.10, 4.11, high quality evidence); eight studies recruiting 1036 women identified an increased prevalence of hard stools/constipation (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.17, high quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Seven studies recruiting 1190 women identified evidence of an increased prevalence of abdominal pain among women randomised to iron (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.41, low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Eight studies recruiting 1214 women did not find any evidence of an increased prevalence of nausea among women randomised to iron (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.82).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Evidence that iron supplementation improves cognitive performance in women is uncertain, as studies could not be meta-analysed and individual studies reported conflicting results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Iron supplementation improved maximal and submaximal exercise performance, and appears to reduce symptomatic fatigue.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Although adherence could not be formally meta-analysed due to differences in reporting, there was no evident difference in adherence between women randomised to iron and control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	Daily iron supplementation effectively reduces the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency, raises haemoglobin and iron stores, improves exercise performance and reduces symptomatic fatigue.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2	These benefits come at the expense of increased gastrointestinal symptomatic side effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008593.pub3	Five studies were included in this review with a total of 1,726 patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008593.pub3	The top-up search resulted in an additional ongoing trial, the results of which have not been incorporated in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008593.pub3	Among five included studies, no reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in the combination arm, with a summary hazard ratio (HR) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.81-1.02).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008593.pub3	Longer progression-free survival was observed in those treated with the combination chemotherapy (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53-0.87), however, this result may have been driven by findings from the single first-line treatment setting study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008593.pub3	The quality of evidence for overall survival was low and for progression-free survival was moderate, mainly due to study limitation from the lack of information on randomisation methods and allocation concealment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008593.pub3	There were higher risks of toxicity outcomes grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea and grade 1 or 2 alopecia, and a lower risk of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in controls compared to the invervention group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008593.pub3	Evidence for toxicity has been assessed to be low to moderate quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008593.pub3	There was no overall survival benefit of the irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine treatment over irinotecan alone, thus both regimens remain reasonable options in treating patients with advanced or metastatic CRC.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008593.pub3	Given the low and moderate quality of the evidence, future studies with sufficient numbers of patients in each treatment arms are needed to clarify the benefit observed in progression-free survival with combination irinotecan and fluoropyrimidines.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005199.pub2	Due to the differences in the method of assessment, the variability of data and the heterogeneity of the participant groups it was difficult to pool some of the outcome data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005199.pub2	Despite these limitations and potentially significant biases related to methodological quality there was evidence to suggest that a transverse or oblique incision has less impact on pulmonary function particularly in the early post-operative period and is less prone to rupture (wound dehiscence/incisional hernia).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005199.pub2	The data on pain is less clear and should be interpreted with caution but some data suggests a transverse incision is less painful.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005199.pub2	There was no difference seen in other early or late post-operative complications and recovery times were similar although the transverse incision may be cosmetically more acceptable.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005199.pub2	The analgesia use and the pulmonary compromise may be reduced with a transverse/oblique incision but this does not seem to be significant clinically as pulmonary complication rates and recovery times were the same.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005199.pub2	The likelihood of wound dehiscence and rupture appears to be reduced with a transverse incision and a transverse incision may look better.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005199.pub2	The methodological and clinical diversity and the potential for bias also mean that the results in favour of a transverse/oblique incision (particularly with regard to analgesic use) should be treated with caution.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005199.pub2	The optimal incision for abdominal surgery still remains the preference of the surgeon.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	We included a total of nine RCTs (981 participants) in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in North America.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 351.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	The mean age across trials ranged between 32.0 and 43.7 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	All included studies were judged as having high risk of performance bias and high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding, and four of the nine studies suffered from at least one additional source of possible bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	In MBR compared to usual care for subacute LBP, individuals receiving MBR had less pain (four studies with 336 participants; SMD -0.46, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.21, moderate-quality of evidence due to risk of bias) and less disability (three studies with 240 participants; SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.01, low-quality of evidence due to risk of bias and inconsistency), as well as increased likelihood of return-to-work (three studies with 170 participants; OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.46 to 6.98, very low-quality of evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision) and fewer sick leave days (two studies with 210 participants; SMD -0.38 95% CI -0.66 to -0.10, low-quality of evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision) at 12-month follow-up.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	The effect sizes for pain and disability were low in terms of clinical meaningfulness, whereas effects for work-related outcomes were in the moderate range.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	However, when comparing MBR to other treatments (i.e. brief intervention with features from a light mobilization program and a graded activity program, functional restoration, brief clinical intervention including education and advice on exercise, and psychological counselling), we found no differences between the groups in terms of pain (two studies with 336 participants; SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.07, low-quality evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias), functional disability (two studies with 345 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.18, low-quality evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias), and time away from work (two studies with 158 participants; SMD -0.25 95% CI -0.98 to 0.47, very low-quality evidence due to serious imprecision, inconsistency and risk of bias).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	Return-to-work was not reported in any of the studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	Although we looked for adverse events in both comparisons, none of the included studies reported this outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	On average, people with subacute LBP who receive MBR will do better than if they receive usual care, but it is not clear whether they do better than people who receive some other type of treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002193.pub2	However, the available research provides mainly low to very low-quality evidence, thus additional high-quality trials are needed before we can describe the value of MBP for clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	We included 18 trials reporting on 4843 participants comparing the effect of bisphosphonate administration to control regimens.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	Primary outcome: there was no clear difference in the proportion of participants with pain response (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.43; P = 0.20; I2 = 0%; 3 trials; 876 participants; low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in a pain response in 40 more participants per 1000 (19 fewer to 114 more).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	Secondary outcomes: bisphosphonates probably reduced the incidence of skeletal-related events in participants with prostate cancer metastatic to bone (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94; P = 0.27; I2 = 19%; 9 trials; 3153 participants; moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 58 fewer SREs per 1000 (85 fewer to 27 fewer).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	We found no clinically relevant differences in mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04; P = 0.43; I2 = 1%; 9 trials; 2450 participants; moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 16 fewer deaths per 1000 (47 fewer to 21 more).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	Outcome definition of quality of life and the measurement tools varied greatly across trials and we were unable to extract any quantitative data for meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	Bisphosphonates probably increased the number of participants affected by nausea (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; P = 0.05; I2 = 0%; 9 trials; 3008 participants; moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in seven more cases of nausea per 1000 (0 fewer to 14 more).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	Bisphosphonates probably increased the number of renal adverse events (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.46; P = 0.01; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; 1794 participants; moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 22 more renal adverse events per 1000 (4 more to 50 more).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	We found no clear difference in the number of participants with osteonecrosis of the jaw between groups (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.90; P = 0.17; I2 = 0%; 5 trials; 1626 participants; very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in seven more cases with osteonecrosis of the jaw per 1000 (2 fewer to 29 more).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	We observed no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of participants with decreased analgesic consumption (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.63; P = 0.28; I2 = 37%; 4 trials; 416 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	Statistical analysis revealed that bisphosphonates probably reduced the number of participants with disease progression (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98; P = 0.006; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; 2115 participants; moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 36 fewer cases of disease progression per 1000 (71 fewer to 7 fewer).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	Findings of our predefined subgroup and sensitivity analyses were no different from those of the primary analyses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	Based on low quality evidence, there may be no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of men with pain response between bisphosphonates and control regimens in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	Bisphosphonates probably decrease the number of skeletal-related events and disease progression.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	These benefits need to be weighed against the increased risk of renal impairment and nausea in men receiving bisphosphonates.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006250.pub2	Future studies should explicitly evaluate patient important outcomes such as quality of life and pain by using standardized and comparable assessment tools.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	Our search strategies led to 3046 potentially relevant references.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	Of these, five RCTs involving 1093 patients were included; four trials in previously untreated patients and one trial in relapsed patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	Overall, the quality of the five trials is judged to be moderate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	All trials were reported as randomised and judged to be open-label studies, because usually trials evaluating stem cell transplantation are not blinded.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	Due to the small number of studies in each analysis (four or less), the quantification of heterogeneity was not reliable and not evaluated in further detail.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	A potential source of bias are uncertainties in the HR calculation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	For OS, the HR had to be calculated for three trials from survival curves, for PFS for two trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	We found a statistically significant increased PFS in previously untreated FL patients in the HDT + ASCT arm (HR = 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.54; P < 0.00001).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	However, this effect is not transferred into a statistically significant OS advantage (HR = 0.97; 95% 0.76 to 1.24; P = 0.81).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	The subgroup of trials adding rituximab to both intervention arms (one trial) confirms these results and the trial had to be stopped early after an interim analysis due to a statistically significant PFS advantage in the HDT + ASCT arm (PFS: HR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.55; OS: HR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.92).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	In the four trials in previously untreated patients there are no statistically significant differences between HDT + ASCT and the control-arm in terms of TRM (RR = 1.28; 95% CI 0.25 to 6.61; P = 0.77), secondary acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (RR = 2.87; 95% CI 0.7 to 11.75; P = 0.14) or solid cancers (RR = 1.20; 95% CI 0.25 to 5.77; P = 0.82).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	Adverse events were rarely reported and were observed more frequently in patients undergoing HDT + ASCT (mostly infections and haematological toxicity).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	For patients with relapsed FL, there is some evidence (one trial, N = 70) that HDT + ASCT is advantageous in terms of PFS and OS (PFS: HR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.61; OS: HR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.89).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	For this trial, no results were reported for TRM, adverse events or secondary cancers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	In summary, the currently available evidence suggests a strong PFS benefit for HDT + ASCT compared with chemotherapy or immuno-chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with FL.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	No statistically significant differences in terms of OS, TRM and secondary cancers were detected.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	These effects are confirmed in a subgroup analysis (one trial) adding rituximab to both treatment arms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	Further trials evaluating this approach are needed to determine this effect more precisely in the era of rituximab.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	Moreover, longer follow-up data are necessary to find out whether the PFS advantage will translate into an OS advantage in previously untreated patients with FL.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2	There is evidence that HDT + ASCT is advantageous in patients with relapsed FL.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	We included 15 randomised trials (1437 participants) of WDD for schizophrenia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	There was a high risk of performance bias within the trials but overall, risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias was low or unclear.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	Data showed WDD improved the short-term global state of participants compared with placebo or no treatment (1 RCT n = 72, RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	When WDD was compared with antipsychotic drugs, such as chlorpromazine or risperidone, no difference in short-term global state of participants was observed (2 RCTs n = 140, RR 1.18 95% CI 0.98 to 1.43, moderate-quality evidence) and mental state (total endpoint Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS): 2 RCTs, n = 140, MD 0.84, 95% CI -4.17 to 5.84, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	However, WDD was associated with fewer people experiencing extrapyramidal effects (EPS) compared with other treatments (2 RCTs 0/70 versus 47/70, n = 140, RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15, moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	WDD is often used as an add-on intervention alongside antipsychotics.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	When WDD + antipsychotic was compared to antipsychotic alone, the combination group had better global state (short-term results, 6 RCTs, n = 684, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.72, moderate-quality evidence) and mental state (short-term total endpoint PANSS: 5 RCTs, n = 580, MD -11.64, 95% CI -13.33 to - 9.94, low-quality evidence), fewer people with EPS (2 RCTs n = 308, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.70, moderate-quality evidence) and reduction of the mean use of risperidone (1 RCT n = 107, MD -0.70, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.53, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	But, there was no effect on weight gain (1 RCT n = 108, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.24, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	When WDD + low-dose antipsychotic was compared with normal-dose antipsychotic alone, the combination again showed benefits for short-term global state (7 RCTs n = 522, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.93, moderate-quality evidence), mental state (total endpoint PANSS: 4 RCTs n = 250, MD -9.53, 95% CI -17.82 to -1.24, low-quality evidence), and fewer participants with EPS (3 RCTS n = 280, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.51, moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	Across all comparisons, we found no data on outcomes directly reporting quality of life, hospital service use and economics.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	Limited evidence suggests that WDD may have some positive short-term antipsychotic global effects compared to placebo or no treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	However when WDD was compared with other antipsychotics there was no effect on global or mental state, but WDD was associated with fewer adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	When WDD was combined with an antipsychotic, positive effects were found for global and mental state and the combination caused fewer adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	The available evidence is not high quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012217.pub2	Better designed large studies are needed to fully and fairly test the effects of WDD for people with schizophrenia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	For this update, we found three new RCTs (228 participants), bringing the total to 12 RCTs with 799 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	We judged three studies to be at high risk of bias, and three to be at low risk of bias; six were unclear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	None of the studies reported the adverse outcome of root resorption.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	The review assessed six comparisons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	1. Multistrand stainless steel versus superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) arch wires.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	There were five studies in this group and it was appropriate to undertake a meta-analysis of two of them.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	There is insufficient evidence from these studies to determine whether there is a difference in rate of alignment between multistrand stainless steel and superelastic NiTi arch wires (mean difference (MD) -7.5 mm per month, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.27 to 11.27; 1 study, 48 participants; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	The findings for pain at day 1 as measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale suggested that there was no meaningful difference between the interventions (MD -2.68 mm, 95% CI -6.75 to 1.38; 2 studies, 127 participants; moderate-quality evidence).	0

10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	There is insufficient evidence from these studies to determine whether there is a difference in alignment or pain between superelastic and thermoelastic NiTi arch wires (low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	Moderate-quality evidence shows that arch wires of coaxial superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) can produce greater tooth movement over 12 weeks than arch wires made of single-strand superelastic NiTi.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	Moderate-quality evidence also suggests there may be no difference in pain at day 1 between multistrand stainless steel arch wires and superelastic NiTi arch wires.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007859.pub4	Other than these findings, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether any particular arch wire material is superior to any other in terms of alignment rate, time to alignment, pain and root resorption.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012034.pub2	This review includes just one cluster-randomised study of 306 older people with dementia and an average age of 86 years, conducted across 16 nursing homes in France.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012034.pub2	The study did not measure any of our primary or secondary outcomes but did measure behavioural change using three measurement scales: the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI; 29-item scale), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; 12-item scale), and the Observation Scale (OS; 25-item scale).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012034.pub2	For the CMAI, the study reports a Global score (29 items rated on a seven-point scale (1 = never occurs to 7 = occurs several times an hour) and summed to give a total score ranging from 29 to 203) and mean scores (evaluable items (rated on the same 7-point scale) divided by the theoretical total number of items) for the following four domains: Physically Non-Aggressive Behaviour, such as pacing (13 items); Verbally Non-Aggressive Behaviour, such as repetition (four items); Physically Aggressive Behaviour, such as hitting (nine items); and Verbally Aggressive Behaviour, such as swearing (three items).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012034.pub2	Four of the five CMAI scales improved in the intervention group (Global: change mean difference (MD) −5.69 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.59 to −1.79; Physically Non-Aggressive: change MD −0.32 points, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.15; Verbally Non-Aggressive: change MD −0.44 points, 95% CI −0.69 to −0.19; and Verbally Aggressive: change MD −0.16 points, 95% CI −0.31 to −0.01).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012034.pub2	There was no difference in change scores on the Physically Aggressive scale (MD −0.08 points, 95% CI −0.37 to 0.21).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012034.pub2	Using GRADE guidelines, we rated the quality of this evidence as very low due to high risk of bias and indirectness of the outcome measures.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012034.pub2	There were no differences in NPI or OS change scores between groups by the end of the study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012034.pub2	We also identified one ongoing study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012034.pub2	The limited evidence means that uncertainty remains around the effectiveness of de-escalation and the relative efficacy of different techniques.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012034.pub2	High-quality research on the effectiveness of this intervention is therefore urgently needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	We included 13 trials with 1316 participants in a qualitative synthesis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	Participants were incontinent for urine, stool, or both, and were residents in a nursing home or were hospitalised.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	Eleven trials had a small sample size and short follow-up periods.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	.The overall risk of bias in the included studies was high.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	The data were not suitable for meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in participant population, skin care products, skin care procedures, outcomes, and measurement tools.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	Nine trials compared different topical skin care products, including a combination of products.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	Two trials tested a structured skin care procedure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	One trial compared topical skin care products alongside frequencies of application.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	One trial compared frequencies of application of topical skin care products.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	We found evidence in two trials, being of low and moderate quality, that soap and water performed poorly in the prevention and treatment of IAD (primary outcomes of this review).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	The first trial indicated that the use of a skin cleanser might be more effective than the use of soap and water (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.87; low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	The second trial indicated that a structured skin care procedure, being a washcloth with cleansing, moisturising, and protecting properties, might be more effective than soap and water (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.79; moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	Findings from the other trials, all being of low to very low quality, suggest that applying a leave-on product (moisturiser, skin protectant, or a combination) might be more effective than not applying a leave-on product.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	No trial reported on the third primary outcome 'number of participants not satisfied with treatment' or on adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	Little evidence, of very low to moderate quality, exists on the effects of interventions for preventing and treating IAD in adults.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	Soap and water performed poorly in the prevention and treatment of IAD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	Application of leave-on products (moisturisers, skin protectants, or a combination) and avoiding soap seems to be more effective than withholding these products.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	The performance of leave-on products depends on the combination of ingredients, the overall formulation and the usage (e.g. amount applied).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	High quality confirmatory trials using standardised, and comparable prevention and treatment regimens in different settings/regions are required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	Furthermore, to increase the comparability of trial results, we recommend the development of a core outcome set, including validated measurement tools.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2	The evidence in this review is current up to 28 September 2016.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	We included seven RCTs with a total of 333 participants in our review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	Three trials studied hospitalised patients, two trials were conducted in an outpatient setting, while the trial setting was unclear in two studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	Participants' ages ranged from two years to young adults.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	The type of antiviral, administration route, and treatment duration varied between the trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	The antivirals in the included studies were acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	Follow-up varied from 20 days to six months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	The diagnosis of IM was based on clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	The risk of bias for all included studies was either unclear or high risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	The quality of evidence was graded as very low for all outcomes and so the results should be interpreted with caution.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	There were statistically significant improvements in the treatment group for two of the 12 outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	These improvements may be of limited clinical significance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	There was a mean reduction in 'time to clinical recovery as assessed by physician' of five days in the treatment group but with wide confidence intervals (CIs) (95% CI -8.04 to -1.08; two studies, 87 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	Prospective studies indicate that clinical signs and symptoms may take one month or more to resolve and that fatigue may be persistent in approximately 10% of patients at six-month follow-up, so this may not be a clinically meaningful result.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	Trial results for the outcome 'adverse events and side effects of medication' were reported narratively in only five studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	In some reports authors were unsure whether an adverse event was related to medication or complication of disease.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	These results could not be pooled due to the potential for double counting results but overall, the majority of trials reporting this outcome did not find any significant difference between treatment and control groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	There was a mean reduction in 'duration of lymphadenopathy' of nine days (95% CI -11.75 to -6.14, two studies, 61 participants) in favour of the treatment group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	In terms of viral shedding, the overall effect from six studies was that viral shedding was suppressed while on antiviral treatment, but this effect was not sustained when treatment stopped.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	For all other outcomes there was no statistically significant difference between antiviral treatment and control groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	The effectiveness of antiviral agents (acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir) in acute IM is uncertain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	The quality of the evidence is very low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	The majority of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias and so questions remain about the effectiveness of this intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	Although two of the 12 outcomes have results that favour treatment over control, the quality of the evidence of these results is very low and may not be clinically meaningful.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	Alongside the lack of evidence of effectiveness, decision makers need to consider the potential adverse events and possible associated costs, and antiviral resistance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011487.pub2	Further research in this area is warranted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	This review examined four trials lasting 24 to 52 weeks involving 2250 people randomised to either insulin detemir or glargine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	Insulin glargine was dosed once-daily in the evening.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	Insulin detemir was initiated once-daily in the evening with the option of an additional dose in the morning in three studies and initiated twice-daily in one study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	Of randomised patients 13.6% to 57.2% were injecting insulin detemir twice-daily at the end of trial.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	The results showed no significant differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia between treatment groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	Insulin detemir was associated with less weight gain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	There was no significant difference in the variability of FPG or glucose values in 24-hour profiles between treatment groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	It was not possible to draw conclusions on quality of life, costs or mortality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy or safety between insulin detemir and insulin glargine for targeting hyperglycaemia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006383.pub2	However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Six crossover trials and two parallel group trials were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Six trials assessed the effects of SNS for FI.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	In the parallel group trial conducted by Tjandra, 53 participants with severe FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group who received optimal medical therapy (mean difference (MD) −5.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.15 to −1.25 at 3 months; MD −6.30, 95% CI −10.34 to −2.26 at 12 months).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Adverse events were reported in a proportion of participants: pain at implant site (6%), seroma (2%) and excessive tingling in the vaginal region (9%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	In the parallel group trial carried out by Thin, 15 participants with FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of FI compared with the percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) group (MD −3.00, 95% CI −6.61 to 0.61 at 3 months; MD −3.20, 95% CI −7.14 to 0.74 at 12 months).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Adverse events were reported in three participants: mild ipsilateral leg pain during temporary testing (n = 1); and stimulator-site pain following insertion of neurostimulator (n = 2).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	In the crossover trial by Leroi 7 of 34 recruited participants were excluded from the crossover due mainly to complications or immediate device failure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Twenty-four of the remaining 27 participants while still blinded chose the period of stimulation they had preferred.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Outcomes were reported separately for 19 participants who preferred the 'on' and five who preferred the 'off' period.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	For the group of 19, the median (range) episodes of faecal incontinence per week fell from 1.7 (0 to 9) during the 'off' period to 0.7 (0 to 5) during the 'on' period; for the group of five, however, the median (range) rose from 1.7 (0 to 11) during the 'off' period compared with 3.7 (0 to 11) during the 'on' period.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Four of 27 participants experienced an adverse event resulting in removal of the stimulator.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	In the crossover trial by Sørensen and colleagues, participants did not experience any FI episodes in either the one-week ‘on’ or ‘off’ periods.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	In the crossover trial by Vaizey, participants reported an average of six, and one, episodes of faecal incontinence per week during the 'off' and 'on' periods respectively in two participants with FI.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Neither study reported adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	In the crossover trial by Kahlke, 14 participants with FI experienced significantly lower episodes of FI per week during the stimulator 'on' (1 (SD, 1.7)) compared with the 'off' period (8.4 (SD, 8.7)).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Adverse events reported include: haematoma formation (n = 3); misplacement of tined lead (1); and pain at stimulator site (n = 1).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Two trials assessed SNS for constipation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	In the Kenefick trial, the two participants experienced an average of two bowel movements per week during the 'off' crossover period, compared with five during the 'on' period.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Abdominal pain and bloating occurred 79% of the time during the 'off' period compared with 33% during the 'on' period.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	No adverse events occurred.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	In contrast, in the trial by Dinning with 59 participants, SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements and 73 adverse events were reported, which included pain at site of the implanted pulse generator (32), wound infection (12), and urological (17) events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	The limited evidence from the included trials suggests that SNS can improve continence in a proportion of patients with faecal incontinence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	However, SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	In addition, adverse events occurred in some patients where these were reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004464.pub3	Rigorous high quality randomised trials are needed to allow the effects of SNS for these conditions to be assessed with more certainty.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008236.pub3	Two trials (n = 190), at low risk of bias, were included in the review and both presented data on first time failure at the tooth level.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008236.pub3	Pooling of the data showed a statistically significant difference in favour of molar bands, with a hazard ratio of 2.92 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.80 to 4.72).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008236.pub3	No statistically significant heterogeneity was shown between the two studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008236.pub3	Data on first time failure at the patient level were also available and showed statistically different difference in favour of molar bands (risk ratio 2.30; 95% CI 1.56 to 3.41) (risk of event for molar tubes = 57%; risk of event for molar bands 25%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008236.pub3	One trial presented data on decalcification again showing a statistically significant difference in favour of molar bands.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008236.pub3	No other adverse events identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008236.pub3	From the two well-designed and low risk of bias trials included in this review it was shown that the failure of molar tubes bonded with either a chemically-cured or light-cured adhesive was considerably higher than that of molar bands cemented with glass ionomer cement.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008236.pub3	One trial indicated that there was less decalcification with molar bands cemented with glass ionomer cement than with bonded molar tubes cemented with a light-cured adhesive.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008236.pub3	However, given there are limited data for this outcome, further evidence is required to draw more robust conclusions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	We identified 66 articles (published between 1988 and 2012) that were eligible according to the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	We collected the data on 7747 patients with gastric cancer who were staged with EUS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	Overall the quality of the included studies was good: in particular, only five studies presented a high risk of index test interpretation bias and two studies presented a high risk of selection bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	For primary tumor (T) stage, results were stratified according to the depth of invasion of the gastric wall.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	The meta-analysis of 50 studies (n = 4397) showed that the summary sensitivity and specificity of EUS in discriminating T1 to T2 (superficial) versus T3 to T4 (advanced) gastric carcinomas were 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.90) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.93) respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	For the diagnostic capacity of EUS to distinguish T1 (early gastric cancer, EGC) versus T2 (muscle-infiltrating) tumors, the meta-analysis of 46 studies (n = 2742) showed that the summary sensitivity and specificity were 0.85 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.91) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.93) respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	When we addressed the capacity of EUS to distinguish between T1a (mucosal) versus T1b (submucosal) cancers the meta-analysis of 20 studies (n = 3321) showed that the summary sensitivity and specificity were 0.87 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.84) respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	Finally, for the metastatic involvement of lymph nodes (N-stage), the meta-analysis of 44 studies (n = 3573) showed that the summary sensitivity and specificity were 0.83 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.87) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.72), respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	Overall, as demonstrated also by the Bayesian nomograms, which enable readers to calculate post-test probabilities for any target condition prevalence, the EUS accuracy can be considered clinically useful to guide physicians in the locoregional staging of people with gastric cancer.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	However, it should be noted that between-study heterogeneity was not negligible: unfortunately, we could not identify any consistent source of the observed heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	Therefore, all accuracy measures reported in the present work and summarizing the available evidence should be interpreted cautiously.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	Moreover, we must emphasize that the analysis of positive and negative likelihood values revealed that EUS diagnostic performance cannot be considered optimal either for disease confirmation or for exclusion, especially for the ability of EUS to distinguish T1a (mucosal) versus T1b (submucosal) cancers and positive versus negative lymph node status.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	By analyzing the data from the largest series ever considered, we found that the diagnostic accuracy of EUS might be considered clinically useful to guide physicians in the locoregional staging of people with gastric carcinoma.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	However, the heterogeneity of the results warrants special caution, as well as further investigation for the identification of factors influencing the outcome of this diagnostic tool.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	Moreover, physicians should be warned that EUS performance is lower in diagnosing superficial tumors (T1a versus T1b) and lymph node status (positive versus negative).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009944.pub2	Overall, we observed large heterogeneity and its source needs to be understood before any definitive conclusion can be drawn about the use of EUS can be proposed in routine clinical settings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	We identified a total of six trials at high risk of bias involving 492 participants undergoing day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 239) versus overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 253) for symptomatic gallstones.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	The number of participants in each trial ranged from 28 to 150.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	The proportion of women in the trials varied between 74% and 84%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	The mean or median age in the trials varied between 40 and 47 years.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	With regards to primary outcomes, only one trial reported short-term mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	However, the trial stated that there were no deaths in either of the groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	We inferred from the other outcomes that there was no short-term mortality in the remaining trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	Long-term mortality was not reported in any of the trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two groups (4 trials; 391 participants; 7/191 (weighted rate 1.6%) in the day-surgery group versus 1/200 (0.5%) in the overnight stay surgery group; rate ratio 3.24; 95% CI 0.74 to 14.09).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	There was no significant difference in quality of life between the two groups (4 trials; 333 participants; SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.33 to 0.10).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the secondary outcomes of our review: pain (3 trials; 175 participants; MD 0.02 cm visual analogue scale score; 95% CI -0.69 to 0.73); time to return to activity (2 trials, 217 participants; MD -0.55 days; 95% CI -2.18 to 1.08); and return to work (1 trial, 74 participants; MD -2.00 days; 95% CI -10.34 to 6.34).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	No significant difference was seen in hospital readmission rate (5 trials; 464 participants; 6/225 (weighted rate 0.5%) in the day-surgery group versus 5/239 (2.1%) in the overnight stay surgery group (rate ratio 1.25; 95% CI 0.43 to 3.63) or in the proportion of people requiring hospital readmissions (3 trials; 290 participants; 5/136 (weighted proportion 3.5%) in the day-surgery group versus 5/154 (3.2%) in the overnight stay surgery group; RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.33 to 3.60).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	No significant difference was seen in the proportion of failed discharge (failure to be discharged as planned) between the two groups (5 trials; 419 participants; 42/205 (weighted proportion 19.3%) in the day-surgery group versus 43/214 (20.1%) in the overnight stay surgery group; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.41).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	For all outcomes except pain, the accrued information was far less than the diversity-adjusted required information size to exclude random errors.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	Day-surgery appears just as safe as overnight stay surgery in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	Day-surgery does not seem to result in improvement in any patient-oriented outcomes such as return to normal activity or earlier return to work.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	The randomised clinical trials backing these statements are weakened by risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006798.pub4	More randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the impact of day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the quality of life as well as other outcomes of patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	We included eight studies, involving 2488 participants, two more studies and 415 more participants than the previous version of this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	Studies were of generally good methodological quality; we judged only one study at high risk of bias, due to small size.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	Two studies used a placebo control and six used 0.04% topical capsaicin as an 'active' placebo to help maintain blinding.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	Efficacy outcomes were inconsistently reported, resulting in analyses for most outcomes being based on less than complete data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	For postherpetic neuralgia, we found four studies (1272 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	At both 8 and 12 weeks about 10% more participants reported themselves much or very much improved with high-concentration capsaicin than with 'active' placebo; the point estimates of numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTs) were 8.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3 to 26) at 8 weeks and 7.0 (95% CI 4.6 to 15) at 12 weeks (2 studies, 571 participants; moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	More participants (about 10%) had average 2 to 8-week and 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline of at least 30% and at least 50% with capsaicin than control, with NNT values between 10 and 12 (2 to 4 studies, 571 to 1272 participants; very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	For painful HIV-neuropathy, we found two studies (801 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	One study reported the proportion of participants who were much or very much improved at 12 weeks (27% with high-concentration capsaicin and 10% with 'active' placebo).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	For both studies, more participants (about 10%) had average 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline of at least 30% with capsaicin than control, with an NNT of 11 (very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	For peripheral diabetic neuropathy, we found one study (369 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	It reported about 10% more participants who were much or very much improved at 8 and 12 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	One small study of 46 participants with persistent pain following inguinal herniorrhaphy did not show a difference between capsaicin and placebo for pain reduction (very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	We downgraded the quality of the evidence for efficacy outcomes by one to three levels due to sparse data, imprecision, possible effects of imputation methods, and susceptibility to publication bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	Local adverse events were common, but not consistently reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	Serious adverse events were no more common with active treatment (3.5%) than control (3.2%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	Adverse event withdrawals did not differ between groups, but lack of efficacy withdrawals were somewhat more common with control than active treatment, based on small numbers of events (six to eight studies, 21 to 67 events; moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to few events).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	No deaths were judged to be related to study medication.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	High-concentration topical capsaicin used to treat postherpetic neuralgia, HIV-neuropathy, and painful diabetic neuropathy generated more participants with moderate or substantial levels of pain relief than control treatment using a much lower concentration of capsaicin.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	These results should be interpreted with caution as the quality of the evidence was moderate or very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	The additional proportion who benefited over control was not large, but for those who did obtain high levels of pain relief, there were usually additional improvements in sleep, fatigue, depression, and quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007393.pub4	High-concentration topical capsaicin is similar in its effects to other therapies for chronic pain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001081.pub3	We included three trials involving 6343 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001081.pub3	As the trials differed in the methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke, we did a pooled analysis of individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient years of follow-up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials using the primary electronic data files, and redefined outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001081.pub3	On re-analysis, there were no significant differences between the trials in the risks of any of the main outcomes in either of the treatment groups, or in the effects of surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001081.pub3	Surgery increased the five-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke in participants with less than 30% stenosis (N = 1746, risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 2.01), had no significant effect in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (N = 1429, RR 0.93, 95%CI 0.62 to 1.38), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (N = 1549, RR 0.84, 95%CI 0.60 to 1.18), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (N = 1095, RR 0.47, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.88).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001081.pub3	However, there was no evidence of benefit (N = 271, RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.57 to 1.84) in participants with near-occlusions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001081.pub3	Ipsilateral ischaemic stroke describes insufficient blood flow to the cerebral hemisphere, secondary to same side severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001081.pub3	Endarterectomy was of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis (moderate-quality evidence), and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001081.pub3	We found no benefit in people with carotid near-occlusion (high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	Randomized controlled trials (RCT) Only one RCT met the inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	The participants underwent enterostomy placement in the frame of an operation for: rectal cancer (37/60), ulcerative colitis (14/60), familial adenomatous polyposis (7/60), and other (2/60).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	The results between the lateral pararectal and the transrectal approach groups were inconclusive for the incidence of parastomal herniation (risk ratio (RR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 4.48; low-quality evidence); development of ileus or stenosis (RR 2.0, 95% CI 0.19 to 20.9; low-quality evidence); or skin irritation (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.13; moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	The results were also inconclusive for the subgroup analysis in which we compared the effect of ileostomy versus colostomy on parastomal herniation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	The study did not measured other stoma-related morbidities, or stoma-related mortality, but did measure quality of life, which was not one of our outcomes of interest.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	Non-randomized studies (NRS)	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	Ten retrospective cohort studies, with a total of 864 participants, met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	The indications for enterostomy placement and the baseline characteristics of the participants (age, co-morbidities, disease-severity) varied between studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	All included studies reported results for the primary outcome (parastomal herniation) and one study also reported data on one of the secondary outcomes (stomal prolapse).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	The effects of different surgical approaches on parastomal herniation (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.75; 10 studies, 864 participants; very low-quality evidence) and the occurrence of stomal prolapse (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.85; 1 study, 145 participants; very low-quality evidence) are uncertain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	None of the included studies measured other stoma-related morbidity or stoma-related mortality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	The present systematic review of randomized and non-randomized studies found inconsistent results between the two compared interventions regarding their potential to prevent parastomal herniation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	In conclusion, there is still a lack of high-quality evidence to support the ideal surgical technique of stoma formation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009487.pub3	The available moderate-, low-, and very low-quality evidence, does not support or refute the superiority of one of the studied stoma formation techniques over the other.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	Four new trials were added after the 2012 search.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	The review now includes 24 relevant studies, with 2126 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	Overall, the evidence was very low quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes of relapse, hospitalisation and general functioning between supportive therapy and standard care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	There were, however, significant differences favouring other psychological or psychosocial treatments over supportive therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	These included hospitalisation rates (4 RCTs, n = 306, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.99, very low quality of evidence), clinical improvement in mental state (3 RCTs, n = 194, RR 1.27 CI 1.04 to 1.54, very low quality of evidence) and satisfaction of treatment for the recipient of care (1 RCT, n = 45, RR 3.19 CI 1.01 to 10.7, very low quality of evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	For this comparison, we found no evidence of significant differences for rate of relapse, leaving the study early and quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	When we compared supportive therapy to cognitive behavioural therapy CBT), we again found no significant differences in primary outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	There were very limited data to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation, and no studies provided data regarding clinically important change in general functioning, one of our primary outcomes of interest.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	There are insufficient data to identify a difference in outcome between supportive therapy and standard care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy but these findings are based on a few small studies where we graded the evidence as very low quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004716.pub4	Future research would benefit from larger trials that use supportive therapy as the main treatment arm rather than the comparator.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	Eleven studies satisfied inclusion criteria, lasting one week or longer; 949 participants with mostly moderate or severe pain were randomised initially, but fewer completed treatment or had results of treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	Eight studies were double-blind, two single-blind, and one open-label.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	None had a placebo only control; eight compared different NSAIDs, three an NSAID with opioid or opioid combination, and one both.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	None compared an NSAID plus opioid with the same dose of opioid alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	Most studies were at high risk of bias for blinding, incomplete outcome data, or small size; none was unequivocally at low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	It was not possible to compare NSAIDs as a group with another treatment, or one NSAID with another NSAID.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	Results for all NSAIDs are reported as a randomised cohort.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	We judged results for all outcomes as very low-quality evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	None of the studies reported our primary outcomes of participants with pain reduction of at least 50%, and at least 30%, from baseline; participants with Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved (or equivalent wording).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	With NSAID, initially moderate or severe pain was reduced to no worse than mild pain after one or two weeks in four studies (415 participants in total), with a range of estimates between 26% and 51% in individual studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	Adverse event and withdrawal reporting was inconsistent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	Two serious adverse events were reported with NSAIDs, and 22 deaths, but these were not clearly related to any pain treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	Common adverse events were thirst/dry mouth (15%), loss of appetite (14%), somnolence (11%), and dyspepsia (11%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	Withdrawals were common, mostly because of lack of efficacy (24%) or adverse events (5%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	There is no high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of NSAIDs alone or in combination with opioids for the three steps of the three-step WHO cancer pain ladder.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012638.pub2	There is very low-quality evidence that some people with moderate or severe cancer pain can obtain substantial levels of benefit within one or two weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	Two studies comprising 287 participants were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	One study (with an overall unclear to high risk of bias) involved 253 participants and the quality of the evidence for most outcomes was very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	This study, reported that pain severity at day two and day three was lower in the tinzaparin group than in the placebo group (P < 0.01, analysis of variance (ANOVA)) and additionally at day 4 (P < 0.05 (ANOVA)).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	Thus tinzaparin resulted in more rapid resolution of pain, as measured with a numerical pain scale.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	The mean difference in duration of painful crises was statistically significant at -1.78 days in favour of the tinzaparin group (95% confidence interval -1.94 to -1.62).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	Participants treated with tinzaparin had statistically significantly fewer hospitalisation days than participants in the group treated with placebo, with a mean difference of -4.98 days (95% confidence interval -5.48 to -4.48).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	Two minor bleeding events were reported as adverse events in the tinzaparin group, and none were reported in the placebo group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	The second study (unclear risk of bias) including 34 participants and was a conference abstract with limited data and only addressed one of the predefined outcomes of the review; i.e. pain intensity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	After one day pain intensity reduced more, as reported on a visual analogue scale, in the dalteparin group than in the placebo group, mean difference -1.30 (95% confidence interval -1.60 to -1.00), with the quality of evidence rated very low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	The most important reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence were serious risk of bias and imprecision (due to low sample size or low occurrence of events).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	Based on the results of two studies, evidence is incomplete to support or refute the effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparins in people with sickle cell disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3	Vaso-occlusive crises are extremely debilitating for sufferers of sickle cell disease; therefore well-designed placebo-controlled studies with other types of low-molecular-weight heparins, and in participants with different genotypes of sickle cell disease, still need to be carried out to confirm or dismiss the results of this single study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000255.pub2	We did not find any completed randomised trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000255.pub2	Comparing antiplatelets with anticoagulants across 36 observational studies (1285 patients), there were no significant differences in the odds of death (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 2.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.60), or the occurrence of ischaemic stroke (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.86) (34 studies, 1262 patients).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000255.pub2	For the outcome of death or disability, there was a non-significant trend in favour of anticoagulants (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.22; P = 0.06) (26 studies, 463 patients).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000255.pub2	Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages (5/627; 0.8%) and major extracranial haemorrhages (7/425; 1.6%) occurred only in the anticoagulation group; however, for both these outcomes, the estimates were imprecise and indicated no significant difference between the two treatment modalities.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000255.pub2	There were no randomised trials comparing either anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs with control, thus there is no evidence to support their routine use for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000255.pub2	There were also no randomised trials that directly compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet drugs and the reported non-randomised studies did not show any evidence of a significant difference between the two.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	We identified 26 RCTs (2066 patients).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	Heterogeneity of treatments and outcomes precluded meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	We grouped results according to wound type, and silver preparation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	Burns Thirteen trials compared topical silver (in a variety of formulations - including silver sulphadiazine (SSD) cream) with non-silver dressings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	One trial showed fewer infections with silver nitrate when compared with a non-silver dressing, but three trials showed significantly more infection with SSD than with the non-silver dressing.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	Six trials compared SSD cream with silver-containing dressings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	One showed significantly fewer infections with the silver-containing dressing (Hydron AgSD) compared with SSD, the remaining five found no evidence of a difference.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	One trial compared two silver-containing dressings, and showed a significantly lower infection rate with silver-coated gauze (Acticoat®) than with silver nitrate gauze.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	Other wounds Six trials compared SSD/silver-containing dressings with non-silver dressings (nine dressings in total).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	Most comparisons (seven) found no significant differences in infection rates; one trial in a variety of wounds exhibited significantly fewer infections with SSD/hydrocolloid, but another, in acute wounds, found significantly more infections with SSD.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	Only one comparison showed a significant reduction in healing time associated with a silver-containing hydrofibre dressing in diabetic foot ulcers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to establish whether silver-containing dressings or topical agents promote wound healing or prevent wound infection; some poor quality evidence for SSD suggests the opposite.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	We included 12 studies with 3571 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	All included studies examined the empiric use of one antimicrobial regimen versus another for the treatment of adults with VAP, but the particular drug regimens examined by each study varied.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	All but one study reported sources of funding or author affiliations with pharmaceutical companies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between monotherapy and combination therapy (N = 4; odds ratio (OR) monotherapy versus combination 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.30), clinical cure (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36), length of stay in ICU (mean difference (MD) 0.65, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.23) or adverse events (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.26).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	We downgraded the quality of evidence for all-cause mortality, adverse events, and length of ICU stay to moderate for this comparison.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	We determined clinical cure for this comparison to be of very low-quality evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	For our second comparison of combination therapy with optional adjunctives only one meta-analysis could be performed due to a lack of trials comparing the same antibiotic regimens.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	Two studies compared tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin for clinical cure in the clinically evaluable population and there was a statistically significant increase in clinical cure for imipenem-cilastatin (N = 2; OR tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.84).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	Of importance, this effect was due to a single study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between carbapenem and non-carbapenem therapies (N = 1; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 0.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.19) or adverse events (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 0.78, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.09), but we found that carbapenems are associated with a statistically significant increase in the clinical cure (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 1.53, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.12 for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and N = 2; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 2.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.43 for clinically evaluable patients analysis).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	For this comparison we downgraded the quality of evidence for mortality, and clinical cure (ITT and clinically evaluable populations) to moderate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	We determined the quality of evidence for adverse events to be low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	We did not find a difference between monotherapy and combination therapy for the treatment of people with VAP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	Since studies did not identify patients with increased risk for multidrug-resistant bacteria, these data may not be generalisable to all patient groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	However, this is the largest meta-analysis comparing monotherapy to multiple antibiotic therapies for VAP and contributes further evidence to the safety of using effective monotherapy for the empiric treatment of VAP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4	Due to lack of studies, we could not evaluate the best antibiotic choice for VAP, but carbapenems as a class may result in better clinical cure than other tested antibiotics.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	We included 29 ITS analyses (12 were controlled) investigating policies targeting 11 drug classes for restriction.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	Participants were most often senior citizens or low income adult populations, or both, in publically subsidized or administered pharmaceutical benefit plans.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	Impact of policies varied by drug class and whether restrictions were implemented or relaxed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	When policies targeted gastric-acid suppressant and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug classes, decreased drug use and substantial savings on drugs occurred immediately and for up to two years afterwards, with no increase in the use of other health services (6 studies).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	Targeting second generation antipsychotic drugs increased treatment discontinuity and the use of other health services without reducing overall drug expenditures (2 studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	Relaxing restrictions for reimbursement of antihypertensives and statins increased appropriate use and decreased overall drug expenditures.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	Two studies which measured health outcomes directly were inconclusive.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	Implementing restrictions to coverage and reimbursement of selected medications can decrease third-party drug spending without increasing the use of other health services (6 studies).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	Relaxing reimbursement rules for drugs used for secondary prevention can also remove barriers to access.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	Policy design, however, needs to be based on research quantifying the harm and benefit profiles of target and alternative drugs to avoid unwanted health system and health effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	Health impact evaluation should be conducted where drugs are not interchangeable.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008654	Impacts on health equity, relating to the fair and just distribution of health benefits in society (sustainable access to publically financed drug benefits for seniors and low income populations, for example), also require explicit measurement.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007447.pub2	Nineteen studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review with data available for a total of 4232 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007447.pub2	The included studies reported a wide variety of interventions, study populations, clinical outcomes and outcome measures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007447.pub2	There was substantial clinical heterogeneity amongst the studies and it was not deemed appropriate to pool data in a meta-analysis.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD007447.pub2	The design of such trials should be cognisant of the limitations of the available evidence presented in this Cochrane Review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006189	Five small trials were included: two trials (30 and 49 participants) of oral steroids or placebo; one trial (40 participants) of oral steroids or no treatment; one trial (28 participants) of oral or intra-articular steroids; and one trial (32 participants) of manipulation under anaesthesia and intraarticular steroid injection with or without oral steroids.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006189	Study participants were similar across trials, but no trial used the same oral steroid regimen or dosage.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006189	Trials were of variable quality (only one of high quality) and some were poorly reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006189	No meta-analyses could be performed as no raw data could be extracted from one placebo-controlled trial and three trials used different comparators.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006189	One trial reported significant short-term benefits of oral steroids versus placebo: 48% more participants reported success (RR = 2 (95% CI 1.3 to 3.1, NNT=2); overall improvement in pain 2.7 (95% CI 1.4 to 4.0) on a 0 to 10 point scale; total shoulder abduction increased by 23.3 degrees (95% CI 11.3 to 35.3); Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) score improved by 18.1 (95% CI 7.6 to 28.6) on a 0 to 100 point scale.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006189	But benefits were not maintained at 6 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006189	A second trial reported no significant differences between oral steroid and placebo in pain or range of movement but it suggested improvement occurred earlier in the steroid treated group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006189	A third trial reported that oral steroids provided a more rapid initial improvement in pain compared to no treatment but negligible differences by five months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006189	There were minimal adverse effects reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006189	Available data from two placebo-controlled trials and one no-treatment controlled trial provides "Silver" level evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) that oral steroids provides significant short-term benefits in pain, range of movement of the shoulder and function in adhesive capsulitis but the effect may not be maintained beyond six weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	Three randomised, placebo-controlled trials with a total of 50 participants were included in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	All three trials compared rTMS with sham TMS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	All the trials were of poor methodological quality and were insufficiently homogeneous to allow the pooling of results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	Moreover, the high rate of attrition further increased the risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	None of the trials provided detailed data on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) scores at six months follow-up which was pre-assigned as our primary outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	One trial contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis of our secondary outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	No difference was seen between rTMS and sham rTMS using the ALSFRS-R scores and manual muscle testing (MMT) scores at 12 months follow-up in this trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	Additionally, none of the trials reported any adverse events associated with the use of rTMS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	However, in view of the small sample size, the methodological limitations and incomplete outcome data, treatment with rTMS cannot be judged as completely safe.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of rTMS in the treatment of ALS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008554.pub3	Further studies may be helpful if their potential benefit is weighed against the impact of participation in a randomised controlled trial on people with ALS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	We included 10 randomised controlled trials (with a total of 1049 participants) of moderate to high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	All studies involved different comparisons, none had a placebo group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	In 1 trial plasma exchange plus prednisone gave significantly better disease control at 1 month (0.3 mg/kg: RR 18.78, 95% CI 1.20 to 293.70) than prednisone alone (1.0 mg/kg: RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.90), while another trial showed no difference in disease control at 6 months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	No differences in disease control were seen for different doses or formulations of prednisolone (one trial each), for azathioprine plus prednisone compared with prednisone alone (one trial), for prednisolone plus azathioprine compared with prednisolone plus plasma exchange (one trial), for prednisolone plus mycophenolate mofetil or plus azathioprine (one trial), for tetracycline plus nicotinamide compared with prednisolone (one trial).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	Chinese traditional medicine plus prednisone was not effective in one trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	There were no significant differences in healing in a comparison of a standard regimen of topical steroids (clobetasol) with a milder regimen (RR 1.00, 95% 0.97 to 1.03) in one trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	In another trial, clobetasol showed significantly more disease control than oral prednisolone in people with extensive and moderate disease (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17), with significantly reduced mortality and adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	Very potent topical steroids are effective and safe treatments for BP, but their use in extensive disease may be limited by side-effects and practical factors.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	Milder regimens (using lower doses of steroids) are safe and effective in moderate BP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	Starting doses of prednisolone greater than 0.75 mg/kg/day do not give additional benefit, lower doses may be adequate to control disease and reduce the incidence and severity of adverse reactions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub3	The effectiveness of adding plasma exchange, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil to corticosteroids, and combination treatment with tetracycline and nicotinamide needs further investigation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004116.pub2	Seventy-five randomised trials, involving 7957 participants with irritable bowel syndrome, met the inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004116.pub2	The methodological quality of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was high, but the quality of remaining trials was generally low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004116.pub2	Seventy-one different herbal medicines were tested in the included trials, in which herbal medicines were compared with placebo or conventional pharmacologic therapy.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD004116.pub2	Compared with conventional therapy in 65 trials testing 51 different herbal medicines, 22 herbal medicines demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for symptom improvement, and 29 herbal medicines were not significantly different than conventional therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004116.pub2	In nine trials that evaluated herbal medicine combined with conventional therapy, six tested herbal preparations showed additional benefit from the combination therapy compared with conventional monotherapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004116.pub2	No serious adverse events from the herbal medicines were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004116.pub2	Some herbal medicines may improve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004116.pub2	However, positive findings from less rigorous trials should be interpreted with caution due to inadequate methodology, small sample sizes, and lack of confirming data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004116.pub2	Some herbal medicines deserve further examination in high-quality trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	We found 22 trials that evaluated pericoital use of LNG and other hormonal drugs on a regular basis to prevent pregnancy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	The studies included a total of 12,400 participants, and were conducted in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	The drugs and doses evaluated included levonorgestrel (LNG) 0.75 mg (11 studies), LNG in doses other than 0.75 mg (4 trials), and hormones other than LNG (7 trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	Outcomes included pregnancy rates, discontinuation, side effects, and acceptability.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	Pericoital levonorgestrel was reasonably efficacious and safe.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	The pooled Pearl Index for the 0.75 mg dose of LNG was 5.4 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 4.1 to 7.0).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	The pooled Pearl Index for all doses of LNG was 5.0 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 4.4 to 5.6).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	Other hormonal drugs appeared promising but most of them were not studied extensively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	Menstrual irregularities were the most common side effects reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	However, the studies provided no consistent evidence of a relationship between bleeding abnormalities and either frequency of pill intake or total dose of the drug.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	Non-menstrual side effects were reportedly mild and not tabulated in most studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	Most women liked the pericoital method in spite of frequent menstrual irregularities.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	The studies of pericoital LNG regimens provided promising results but many had serious methodological issues.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	Most reports were decades old and provided limited information.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	However, we considered the evidence to be moderate quality because of the large number of participants from diverse populations, the low pregnancy rates, and the consistent results across studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	Rigorous research is still needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of pericoital use of LNG as a primary means of contraception among women with infrequent intercourse.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3	If the method is shown to be efficacious, safe and acceptable, the results may warrant revision of the current World Health Organization recommendations and marketing strategies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	Fourteen new studies were added in this update resulting in a total of 15 studies reporting data from 561 randomised patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	The age range of patients was commonly restricted to adolescents or young adults, however the participants of two studies were from a much wider age range (12 to 54 years).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	The distribution of males and females was similar in eight of the studies, with a predominance of female patients in seven studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	Eight studies were assessed to be at high overall risk of bias; six studies at unclear risk of bias; one study at low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	Ten studies with 407 randomised and 390 analysed patients compared surgical anchorage with conventional anchorage for the primary outcome of mesiodistal movement of upper first molars.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	We carried out a random-effects model meta-analysis for the seven studies that fully reported this outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	There was strong evidence of an effect of surgical anchorage on this outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	Compared with conventional anchorage, surgical anchorage was more effective in the reinforcement of anchorage by 1.68 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.27 mm to -1.09 mm; seven studies, 308 participants analysed) with moderate quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias, five studies at unclear risk of bias, one study at low risk of bias).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	This result should be interpreted with some caution, however, as there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity for this comparison.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	There was no evidence of a difference in overall duration of treatment between surgical and conventional anchorage (-0.15 years; 95% CI -0.37 years to 0.07 years; three studies, 111 analysed patients) with low quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias and two studies at unclear risk of bias).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	Information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and acceptability was limited and inconclusive.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	When direct comparisons were made between two types of surgical anchorage, there was a lack of evidence to suggest that any one technique was better than another.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	No included studies reported adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	There is moderate quality evidence that reinforcement of anchorage is more effective with surgical anchorage than conventional anchorage, and that results from mini-screw implants are particularly promising.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005098.pub3	While surgical anchorage is not associated with the inherent risks and compliance issues related to extraoral headgear, none of the included studies reported on harms of surgical or conventional anchorage.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007784.pub2	We included 50 studies (45,285 participants): 47 studies (39,820 participants) compared statins with placebo or no treatment and three studies (5547 participants) compared two different statin regimens in adults with CKD who were not yet on dialysis.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD009524.pub2	We considered the evidence provided on these outcomes to be of overall low quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009524.pub2	However, there was some high quality evidence showing a very small benefit of latrepirdine on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD -1.77, 95% CI -3.09 to -0.45, 3 studies, P = 0.009) at study endpoint (26 or 52 weeks).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009524.pub2	Additionally, moderate quality evidence suggested that latrepirdine and placebo were comparable in adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14, P = 0.51), serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.35, P = 0.52), dropouts (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.27, P = 0.57) and dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.67, P = 0.93).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009524.pub2	Our meta-analysis is limited by the small number of studies, imprecision, inconsistencies between studies and likelihood of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009524.pub2	Nevertheless, the evidence to date suggests that while not associated with an increased risk of adverse events compared with placebo, there is no effect of latrepirdine on cognition and function in mild-to-moderate AD patients, though there appears to be a modest benefit for behaviour.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009524.pub2	Further studies should investigate the potential benefit of latrepirdine on neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	We included seven trials, involving 735 participants, in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	We evaluated risk of bias and judged it to be low for generation of allocation sequence in six studies and unclear in one study; unclear for allocation concealment in four studies and low in three studies; high for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) in five studies and low in two studies; high for blinding in three studies and low in four studies; low for selective reporting; and high for other sources of bias in six studies and low in one study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	In people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by RIC (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83; 2 trials, 182 participants, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	No participants experienced death or cardiovascular events during the period of the studies; and no trial reported haemorrhagic stroke or improvement in neurological, phycological or cognitive impairment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	In people with acute ischaemic stroke, there was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	No trial reported ischaemic stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, improvement in neurological impairment, hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular events, and RIC associated adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	We found low-quality evidence that RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in participants with intracerebral artery stenosis and reduce stroke severity in participants undergoing carotid stenting, but it may increase death or dependence in participants with acute ischaemic stroke who are undergoing intravenous thrombolysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2	However, there is considerable uncertainty about these conclusions because of the small number of studies and low quality of the evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	We included six RCTs, involving 204 preterm infants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	Low-quality evidence showed that protein supplementation of human milk increased in-hospital rates of growth in weight (MD 3.82 g/kg/day, 95% CI 2.94 to 4.7; five RCTs, 101 infants; I² = 73%), length (MD 0.12 cm/wk, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.17; four RCTs, 68 infants; I² = 89%), and head circumference (MD 0.06 cm/wk, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.12; four RCTs, 68 infants; I² = 84%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	There was no evidence of a clear difference in rate of growth of skin fold thickness between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups (triceps MD 0.06 mm/wk, 95% CI –0.09 to 0.21; one RCT, 20 infants; or subscapular MD 0.00 mm/wk, 95% CI –0.17 to 0.17; one RCT, 20 infants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	Protein supplementation led to longer hospital stays (MD 18.5 days, 95% CI 4.39 to 32.61; one RCT, 20 infants; very low-quality evidence), and higher blood urea nitrogen concentrations compared to the unsupplemented group (MD 0.95 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; four RCTs, 81 infants; I² = 56%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	Very low-quality evidence did not show that protein supplementation clearly increased the risk of feeding intolerance (RR 2.70, 95% CI 0.13 to 58.24; one RCT, 17 infants), or necrotizing enterocolitis (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.12; one RCT, 76 infants), or clearly altered serum albumin concentrations (MD 2.5 g/L, 95% CI –5.66 to 10.66; one RCT, 11 infants), compared with the unsupplemented groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	No data were available about the effects of protein supplementation on long-term growth, body mass index, body composition, neurodevelopmental, or cardio-metabolic outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	Low-quality evidence showed that protein supplementation of human milk, fed to preterm infants, increased short-term growth.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	However, the small sample sizes, low precision, and very low-quality evidence regarding duration of hospital stay, feeding intolerance, and necrotising enterocolitis precluded any conclusions about these outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	There were no data on outcomes after hospital discharge.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	Our findings may not be generalisable to low-resource settings, as none of the included studies were conducted in these settings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000433.pub2	Since protein supplementation of human milk is now usually done as a component of multi-nutrient fortifiers, future studies should compare different amounts of protein in multi-component fortifiers, and be designed to determine the effects on duration of hospital stay and safety, as well as on long-term growth, body composition, cardio-metabolic, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	The review includes 45 studies: 14 RCTs and 31 ITS studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	Almost all the included studies (44/45) compared the effectiveness of PEM to no intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	One single study compared paper-based PEM to the same document delivered on CD-ROM.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	Based on seven RCTs and 54 outcomes, the median absolute risk difference in categorical practice outcomes was 0.02 when PEMs were compared to no intervention (range from 0 to +0.11).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	Based on three RCTs and eight outcomes, the median improvement in standardised mean difference for continuous profession practice outcomes was 0.13 when PEMs were compared to no intervention (range from -0.16 to +0.36).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	Only two RCTs and two ITS studies reported patient outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	In addition, we re-analysed 54 outcomes from 25 ITS studies, using time series regression and observed statistically significant improvement in level or in slope in 27 outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	From the ITS studies, we calculated improvements in professional practice outcomes across studies after PEM dissemination (standardised median change in level = 1.69).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	From the data gathered, we could not comment on which PEM characteristic influenced their effectiveness.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	The results of this review suggest that when used alone and compared to no intervention, PEMs may have a small beneficial effect on professional practice outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	There is insufficient information to reliably estimate the effect of PEMs on patient outcomes, and clinical significance of the observed effect sizes is not known.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3	The effectiveness of PEMs compared to other interventions, or of PEMs as part of a multifaceted intervention, is uncertain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	A total of 5271 references were screened and of these 23 RCTs met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	Most were conducted in the USA and in health-care clinics (e.g. family planning).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	The majority of interventions provided information about STIs and taught safer sex skills (e.g. communication), occasionally supplemented with provision of resources (e.g. free sexual health services).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	They were heterogeneous in duration, contact time, provider, behavioural aims and outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	A variety of STIs were addressed including HIV and chlamydia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	None of the trials explicitly mentioned HPV or cervical cancer prevention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	Statistically significant effects for behavioural outcomes (e.g. increasing condom use) were common, though not universal and varied according to the type of outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	There were no statistically significant effects of abstaining from or reducing sexual activity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	There were few statistically significant effects on biological (STI) outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	Considerable uncertainty exists in the risk of bias due to incomplete or ambiguous reporting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	Behavioural interventions for young women which aim to promote sexual behaviours protective of STI transmission can be effective, primarily at encouraging condom use.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	Future evaluations should include a greater focus on HPV and its link to cervical cancer, with long-term follow-up to assess impact on behaviour change, rates of HPV infection and progression to cervical cancer.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	Studies should use an RCT design where possible with integral process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001035.pub2	Given the predominance of USA studies in this systematic review evaluations conducted in other countries would be particularly useful.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	We included twenty studies with a total number of 2337 participants in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	Nineteen studies compared brief psychoeducation with routine care or conventional delivery of information.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	One study compared brief psychoeducation with cognitive behavior therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	Participants receiving brief psychoeducation were less likely to be non-compliant with medication than those receiving routine care in the short term (n = 448, 3 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.41 to 0.96, moderate quality evidence) and medium term (n = 118, 1 RCT, RR 0.17 CI 0.05 to 0.54, low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	Compliance with follow-up was similar between the two groups in the short term (n = 30, 1 RCT, RR 1.00, CI 0.24 to 4.18), medium term (n = 322, 4 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.50 to 1.09) and long term (n = 386, 2 RCTs, RR 1.19, CI 0.83 to 1.72).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	Relapse rates were significantly lower amongst participants receiving brief psychoeducation than those receiving routine care in the medium term (n = 406, RR 0.70 CI 0.52 to 0.93, moderate quality evidence), but not in the long term.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	Data from a few individual studies supported that brief psychoeducation: i) can improve the long-term global state (n = 59, 1 RCT, MD -6.70 CI -13.38 to -0.02, very low quality evidence); ii) promote improved mental state in short term (n = 60, 1 RCT, MD -2.70 CI -4.84 to -0.56,low quality evidence) and medium term; iii) can lower the incidence and severity of anxiety and depression.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	Social function such as rehabilitation status (n = 118, 1 RCT, MD -13.68 CI -14.85 to -12.51, low quality evidence) and social disability (n = 118, 1 RCT, MD -1.96 CI -2.09 to -1.83, low quality evidence) were also improved in the brief psychoeducation group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	There was no difference found in quality of life as measured by GQOLI-74 in the short term (n = 62, 1 RCT, MD 0.63 CI -0.79 to 2.05, low quality evidence), nor the death rate in either groups (n = 154, 2 RCTs, RR 0.99, CI 0.15 to 6.65, low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	Based on mainly low to very low quality evidence from a limited number of studies, brief psychoeducation of any form appears to reduce relapse in the medium term, and promote medication compliance in the short term.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010823.pub2	A brief psychoeducational approach could potentially be effective, but further large, high-quality studies are needed to either confirm or refute the use of this approach.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	We included 11 studies comprising 9839 participants in our quantitative analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	Most studies included people with moderate to severe COPD, without recent exacerbations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	One pharmaceutical sponsored trial that included only people with recent exacerbations was the largest study and accounted for 37% of participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	All but one study were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, thus we rated them as having a high risk of 'other bias'.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	The unsponsored study was at high risk of performance and detection bias, and possible selective reporting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	Five studies recruited GOLD Category B participants, one study recruited Category D participants, two studies recruited Category A/B participants, and three studies recruited participants regardless of category.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	Follow-up ranged from 6 to 52 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	Compared to the LABA+ICS arm, the results for the pooled primary outcomes for the LAMA+LABA arm were as follows: exacerbations, OR 0.82 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.96, P = 0.01, I2 = 17%, low quality evidence); serious adverse events (SAE), OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.05, P = 0.18, I2 = 0, moderate quality evidence); St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score change from the baseline, MD -1.22 (95% CI -2.52 to 0.07, P = 0.06, I2 = 71%, low quality evidence); and trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) change from the baseline, MD 0.08 L (95% CI 0.06 to 0.09, P < 0.0001, I2 = 50%, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	Compared to the LABA+ICS arm, the results for the pooled secondary outcomes for the LAMA+LABA arm were as follows: pneumonia, OR 0.57 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79, P = 0.0006, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence); all-cause death, OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.67, P = 0.88, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence); and SGRQ total score change from the baseline of 4 points or greater (the minimal clinically important difference for the SGRQ is 4 points), OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.44, P = 0.002, I2 = 0%, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	For the treatment of COPD, LAMA+LABA has fewer exacerbations, a larger improvement of FEV1, a lower risk of pneumonia, and more frequent improvement in quality of life as measured by an increase over 4 units or more of the SGRQ.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012066.pub2	These data were supported by low or moderate quality evidence generated from mainly participants with moderate to severe COPD in heterogeneous trials with an observation period of less than one year.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	The evidence for all outcomes in this comparison was of low quality, downgraded for serious imprecision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	All children were discharged, but information on hospitalisation, intubation, or re-presenting to emergency departments was not reported.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to imprecision and high risk of bias related to open-label design.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	Information on heart rate and intubation was not reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	In the third study, 29 children with moderate to severe croup received intramuscular dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg) and either heliox with one to two doses of nebulised saline, or 100% oxygen with one to two doses of adrenaline for three hours.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	Heliox may slightly improve croup scores at 90 minutes postintervention, but may have little or no difference overall using repeated measures analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to high risk of bias related to inadequate reporting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	Information on hospitalisation or re-presenting to the emergency department was not reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	The included studies did not report on adverse events, intensive care admissions, or parental anxiety.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	We could not pool the available data because each comparison included data from only one study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	Due to very limited evidence, uncertainty remains about the effectiveness and safety of heliox.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	Heliox may not be more effective than 30% humidified oxygen for children with mild croup, but may be beneficial in the short term for children with moderate to severe croup treated with dexamethasone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	The effect may be similar to 100% oxygen given with one or two doses of adrenaline.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	Adverse events were not reported, and it is unclear if these were monitored in the included studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub5	Adequately powered RCTs comparing heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox in the treatment of children with moderate to severe croup.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	Eight studies set in primary (four), secondary (one) and tertiary care (accident and emergency = three) were included in the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	Overall, the risk of bias of studies was moderate with high risk of selection and verification bias the predominant flaws.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	Reporting of index and reference tests was poor.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	The prevalence of vertebral fracture in accident and emergency settings ranged from 6.5% to 11% and in primary care from 0.7% to 4.5%.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	There were 29 groups of index tests investigated however, only two featured in more than two studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	Descriptive analyses revealed that three red flags in primary care were potentially useful with meaningful positive likelihood ratios (LR+) but mostly imprecise estimates (significant trauma, older age, corticosteroid use; LR+ point estimate ranging 3.42 to 12.85, 3.69 to 9.39, 3.97 to 48.50 respectively).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	One red flag in tertiary care appeared informative (contusion/abrasion; LR+ 31.09, 95% CI 18.25 to 52.96).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	The results of combined tests appeared more informative than individual red flags with LR+ estimates generally greater in magnitude and precision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	The available evidence does not support the use of many red flags to specifically screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting for LBP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	Based on evidence from single studies, few individual red flags appear informative as most have poor diagnostic accuracy as indicated by imprecise estimates of likelihood ratios.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	When combinations of red flags were used the performance appeared to improve.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	From the limited evidence, the findings give rise to a weak recommendation that a combination of a small subset of red flags may be useful to screen for vertebral fracture.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	It should also be noted that many red flags have high false positive rates; and if acted upon uncritically there would be consequences for the cost of management and outcomes of patients with LBP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008643.pub2	Further research should focus on appropriate sets of red flags and adequate reporting of both index and reference tests.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006934.pub3	Two randomised trials were identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006934.pub3	One trial compared the outcomes of surgical urethral dilatation and optical urethrotomy in 210 adult men with urethral stricture disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006934.pub3	No significant difference was found in the proportion of men being stricture free at three years or in the median time to recurrence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006934.pub3	The second trial compared the outcomes of urethrotomy and urethroplasty in 50 men with traumatic stricture of the posterior urethra following pelvic fracture injury.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006934.pub3	In the first six months, men were more likely to require further surgery in the urethrotomy group than in the primary urethroplasty group (RR 3.39, 95% CI 1.62 to 7.07).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006934.pub3	After two years, 16 of 25 (64%) men initially treated by urethrotomy required continued self-dilatation or further surgery for stricture recurrence compared to 6 of 25 (24%) men treated by primary urethroplasty.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006934.pub3	There were insufficient data to perform meta-analysis or to reliably determine effect size.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006934.pub3	There were insufficient data to determine which intervention is best for urethral stricture disease in terms of balancing efficacy, adverse effects and costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006934.pub3	Well designed, adequately powered multi-centre trials are needed to answer relevant clinical questions regarding treatment of men with urethral strictures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	Six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) met the inclusion criteria for a total of seven group comparisons.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	The four paediatric trials (two involving preschool children and two school-aged children) and two adult parallel-group trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma contributed to the meta-analyses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32; the large confidence interval translates into a risk of exacerbations in the intermittent ICS group varying between 17% and 25%, assuming a 19% risk with daily ICS).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	Age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	Compared to the daily ICS group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller improvement in change from baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56% (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%), fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14% to -4%), more use of rescue β2-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23) and a greater increase from baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per billion (95% CI 11.95 to 21.64).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	There was no significant group difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse effects, hospitalisations, emergency department visits or withdrawals.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	In paediatric trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and beclomethasone) were associated with greater growth by 0.41 cm change from baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69) compared to daily treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	In children and adults with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, there was low quality evidence that intermittent and daily ICS strategies were similarly effective in the use of rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	The strength of the evidence means that we cannot currently assume equivalence between the two options..	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever use.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009611.pub3	Clinicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one year) impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	We included 17 studies involving 1639 people with CKD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Three studies enrolled 341 people treated with dialysis, four studies enrolled 168 kidney transplant recipients, and 10 studies enrolled 1130 people with CKD stages 1 to 5. Eleven studies (900 people) evaluated dietary counselling with or without lifestyle advice and six evaluated dietary patterns (739 people), including one study (191 people) of a carbohydrate-restricted low-iron, polyphenol enriched diet, two studies (181 people) of increased fruit and vegetable intake, two studies (355 people) of a Mediterranean diet and one study (12 people) of a high protein/low carbohydrate diet.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Risks of bias in the included studies were generally high or unclear, lowering confidence in the results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Participants were followed up for a median of 12 months (range 1 to 46.8 months).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Studies were not designed to examine all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	In very-low quality evidence, dietary interventions had uncertain effects on all-cause mortality or ESKD.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	In absolute terms, dietary interventions may prevent one person in every 3000 treated for one year avoiding ESKD, although the certainty in this effect was very low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Across all 17 studies, outcome data for cardiovascular events were sparse.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Dietary interventions in low quality evidence were associated with a higher health-related quality of life (2 studies, 119 people: MD in SF-36 score 11.46, 95% CI 7.73 to 15.18; I2 = 0%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Adverse events were generally not reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Dietary interventions lowered systolic blood pressure (3 studies, 167 people: MD -9.26 mm Hg, 95% CI -13.48 to -5.04; I2 = 80%) and diastolic blood pressure (2 studies, 95 people: MD -8.95, 95% CI -10.69 to -7.21; I2 = 0%) compared to a control diet.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Dietary interventions were associated with a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (5 studies, 219 people: SMD 1.08; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.97; I2 = 88%) and serum albumin levels (6 studies, 541 people: MD 0.16 g/dL, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.24; I2 = 26%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	A Mediterranean diet lowered serum LDL cholesterol levels (1 study, 40 people: MD -1.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.44).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Dietary interventions have uncertain effects on mortality, cardiovascular events and ESKD among people with CKD as these outcomes were rarely measured or reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Dietary interventions may increase health-related quality of life, eGFR, and serum albumin, and lower blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011998.pub2	Based on stakeholder prioritisation of dietary research in the setting of CKD and preliminary evidence of beneficial effects on risks factors for clinical outcomes, large-scale pragmatic RCTs to test the effects of dietary interventions on patient outcomes are required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006435.pub2	Only one study (156 children aged between seven weeks and 24 months with signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis) met the eligibility criteria for inclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006435.pub2	Participants were randomised into three groups: nebulised salbutamol, nebulised saline and mist in a tent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006435.pub2	The results showed a significant decrease in respiratory distress symptom (RDS) score in the nebulised salbutamol group but no significant decrease in the RDS score in the mist in a tent or nebulised saline groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006435.pub2	The study did not report on adverse effects of the interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006435.pub2	Steam inhalation (or cool mist therapy) is commonly used to treat acute bronchiolitis in resource-constrained settings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006435.pub2	One study was eligible for inclusion and found that nebulised salbutamol was an effective intervention for young children with bronchiolitis but mist in a tent did not lead to a significant decrease in RDS score.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006435.pub2	Since only one study was analysed it would be misleading to conclude that mist therapy is ineffective in children with bronchiolitis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006435.pub2	We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to inform practice regarding using steam inhalation or mist therapy for acute bronchiolitis in children up to three years old.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	We identified four studies (1154 participants, age range 50 to 90 years).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	All participants had a diagnosis of probable or possible AD according to standard criteria and most participants were established on a cholinesterase inhibitor.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	The primary outcome in all studies was change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) from baseline.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	When we pooled data, there was no significant benefit from statin (mean difference -0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.05 to 0.52, P value = 0.51).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	All studies provided change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) from baseline.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	There was no significant benefit from statins in MMSE when we pooled the data (mean difference -0.32, 95% CI -0.71 to 0.06, P value = 0.10).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	Three studies reported treatment-related adverse effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	When we pooled data, there was no significant difference between statins and placebo (odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.06, P value = 0.78).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	There was no significant difference in behaviour, global function or activities of daily living in the statin and placebo groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	We assessed risk of bias as low for all studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	We found no studies assessing role of statins in treatment of VaD.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007514.pub3	Analyses from the studies available, including two large randomised controlled trials, indicate that statins have no benefit on the primary outcome measures of ADAS-Cog or MMSE.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	Four studies involving 149 participants met inclusion criteria for this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	Two studies assessed the effect of night splinting in a total of 26 children and adults with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between wearing a night splint and not wearing a night splint.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	One study assessed the efficacy of prednisone treatment in 103 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	While a daily dose of prednisone at 0.75 mg/kg/day resulted in significant improvements in some strength and function parameters compared with placebo, there was no significant difference in ankle range of motion between groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	Increasing the prednisone dose to 1.5 mg/kg/day had no significant effect on ankle range of motion.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	One study evaluated early surgery in 20 young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	Surgery resulted in increased ankle dorsiflexion range at 12 months but functional outcomes favoured the control group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	By 24 months, many boys in the surgical group experienced a relapse of achilles tendon contractures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	There is no evidence of significant benefit from any intervention for increasing ankle range of motion in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A or Duchenne muscular dystrophy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006973.pub2	Further research is required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003934.pub4	Results should be interpreted with caution as the methodological quality of the 25 included trials (5218 women) was variable.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003934.pub4	For Comparison 1: Upright and ambulant positions versus recumbent positions and bed care, the first stage of labour was approximately one hour and 22 minutes shorter for women randomised to upright as opposed to recumbent positions (average MD -1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.22 to -0.51; 15 studies, 2503 women; random-effects, T2 = 2.39, Chi2 = 203.55, df = 14, (P < 0.00001), I2 = 93%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003934.pub4	Women who were upright were also less likely to have caesarean section (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.94; 14 studies, 2682 women) and less likely to have an epidural (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.99, nine studies, 2107 women; random-effects, T2 = 0.02, I2 = 61%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003934.pub4	Babies of mothers who were upright were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, however this was based on one trial (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89, one study, 200 women).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003934.pub4	There were no significant differences between groups for other outcomes including duration of the second stage of labour, or other outcomes related to the well being of mothers and babies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003934.pub4	For Comparison 2: Upright and ambulant positions versus recumbent positions and bed care (with epidural: all women), there were no significant differences between groups for outcomes including duration of the second stage of labour, or other outcomes related to the well being of mothers and babies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003934.pub4	There is clear and important evidence that walking and upright positions in the first stage of labour reduces the duration of labour, the risk of caesarean birth, the need for epidural, and does not seem to be associated with increased intervention or negative effects on mothers' and babies' well being.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003934.pub4	Given the great heterogeneity and high performance bias of study situations, better quality trials are still required to confirm with any confidence the true risks and benefits of upright and mobile positions compared with recumbent positions for all women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003934.pub4	Based on the current findings, we recommend that women in low-risk labour should be informed of the benefits of upright positions, and encouraged and assisted to assume whatever positions they choose.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	This review was complicated by a lack of generally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of TOS and had to rely exclusively on the diagnosis of TOS by the investigators in the reviewed studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	We identified one study comparing natural progression with an active intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	We found three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but only two of them had a follow-up of six months or more, which was the minimum required follow-up for inclusion in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	The first trial that met our requirements involved 55 participants with the 'disputed type' of TOS and compared transaxillary first rib resection (TFRR) with supraclavicular neuroplasty of the brachial plexus (SNBP).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	The trial had a high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	TFRR decreased pain more than SNBP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	There were no adverse effects in either group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	The second trial that met these requirements analyzed 37 people with TOS of any type, comparing treatment with a botulinum toxin (BTX) injection into the scalene muscles with a saline placebo injection.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	This trial had a low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	There was no significant effect of treatment with the BTX injection over placebo in terms of pain relief or improvements in disability, but it did significantly improve paresthesias at six months' follow-up.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	This review was complicated by a lack of generally accepted diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of TOS.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	There was very low quality evidence that transaxillary first rib resection decreased pain more than supraclavicular neuroplasty, but no randomized evidence that either is better than no treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	There is moderate evidence to suggest that treatment with BTX injections yielded no great improvements over placebo injections of saline.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	There is no evidence from RCTs for the use of other currently used treatments.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007218.pub3	There is a need for an agreed definition for the diagnosis of TOS, especially the disputed form, agreed outcome measures, and high quality randomized trials that compare the outcome of interventions with no treatment and with each other.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	Twenty-one trials involving 884 people were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	A hand brace significantly improved symptoms after four weeks (weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.29 to -0.85) and function (WMD -0.55; 95% CI -0.82 to -0.28).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	In an analysis of pooled data from two trials (63 participants) ultrasound treatment for two weeks was not significantly beneficial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	However one trial showed significant symptom improvement after seven weeks of ultrasound (WMD -0.99; 95% CI -1.77 to - 0.21) which was maintained at six months (WMD -1.86; 95% CI -2.67 to -1.05).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	Four trials involving 193 people examined various oral medications (steroids, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) versus placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	Compared to placebo, pooled data for two-week oral steroid treatment demonstrated a significant improvement in symptoms (WMD -7.23; 95% CI -10.31 to -4.14).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	One trial also showed improvement after four weeks (WMD -10.8; 95% CI -15.26 to -6.34).	0

10.1002/14651858.CD003219	In two trials involving 50 people, vitamin B6 did not significantly improve overall symptoms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	In one trial involving 51 people yoga significantly reduced pain after eight weeks (WMD -1.40; 95% CI -2.73 to -0.07) compared with wrist splinting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	In one trial involving 21 people carpal bone mobilisation significantly improved symptoms after three weeks (WMD -1.43; 95% CI -2.19 to -0.67) compared to no treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	In one trial involving 50 people with diabetes, steroid and insulin injections significantly improved symptoms over eight weeks compared with steroid and placebo injections.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD003219	Trials of magnet therapy, laser acupuncture, exercise or chiropractic care did not demonstrate symptom benefit when compared to placebo or control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003219	Current evidence shows significant short-term benefit from oral steroids, splinting, ultrasound, yoga and carpal bone mobilisation.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD003219	More trials are needed to compare treatments and ascertain the duration of benefit.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	We included two RCTs that enrolled a total of 708 participants with CRVO-ME.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	SCORE compared triamcinolone acetonide intravitreal injections (n = 165) with observation (n = 72); GENEVA compared dexamethasone intravitreal implants (n = 290) with sham injections (n = 147).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	We observed characteristics indicative of high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data in SCORE and selective outcome reporting in GENEVA.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	Loss to follow-up was high with 10% in the steroid groups and almost twice as much (17%) in the observation group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	GENEVA enrolled participants with both branch and central retinal vein occlusion, but did not present subgroup data for the CRVO-ME population.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	A qualitative assessment of the results from GENEVA indicated that the dexamethasone implant was not associated with improvement in visual acuity after six months among participants with CRVO-ME.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	Although the SCORE investigators reported that participants treated with 1 mg (n = 82) or 4 mg (n = 83) triamcinolone intravitreal injections were five times more likely to have gained 15 letters or more in visual acuity compared with participants in the observation group (1 mg; risk ratio (RR): 5.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62 to 17.15; 4 mg RR 4.92; 95% CI 1.50 to 16.10) by the eighth-month follow-up examination, the average visual acuity decreased in all three groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	However, eyes treated with triamcinolone lost fewer letters than participants in the observation group at 8 months (1 mg mean difference (MD): 8.70 letters, 95% CI 1.86 to 15.54; 4 mg MD: 9.80 letters, 95% CI 3.32 to 16.28).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	A higher incidence of adverse events was noted with IVS therapy when compared with observation alone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	As many as 20% to 35% of participants experienced an adverse event in the IVS groups compared with 8% of participants in the observation group of the SCORE study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	The GENEVA investigators reported 63% in the treatment arm versus 43% in the observation arm experienced an adverse event.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	The most commonly encountered adverse events were elevated intraocular pressure, progression of cataracts, and retinal neovascularization.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	We graded the quality of evidence as low due to study limitations, imprecision of treatment estimates, and selective outcome reporting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	The two RCTs reviewed herein provide insufficient evidence to determine the benefits of IVS for individuals with CRVO-ME.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	The improvement in visual acuity noted in the SCORE trial should be interpreted with caution as outcome data were missing for a large proportion of the observation group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007324.pub3	Adverse events were observed more often with IVS treatment compared with observation/no treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006286.pub2	Six randomised trials involving a total of 394 patients were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006286.pub2	Five of the six trials demonstrated a significant efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in improving nasal obstruction symptoms and in reducing adenoid size.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006286.pub2	The first eight-week cross-over study showed that treatment with beclomethasone (336 mcg/day) yielded a greater improvement in mean symptom scores than placebo (-18.5 versus -8.5, P < 0.05) and a larger reduction in mean adenoid/choana ratio than placebo (right, -14% versus +0.4%, P = 0.002; left, -15% versus -2.0%, P = 0.0006) between week 0 and week 4.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006286.pub2	The second four-week cross-over study showed that the Nasal Obstruction Index decreased by at least 50% from baseline in 38% of patients treated with beclomethasone (400 mcg/day) between week 0 and week 2, whereas none of the patients treated with placebo had such improvement (P < 0.01).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006286.pub2	The third parallel-group trial showed that 77.7% of patients treated with mometasone (100 mcg/day) for 40 days demonstrated an improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms and a decrease in adenoid size, such that adenoidectomy could be avoided, whereas no significant improvement was observed in the placebo group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006286.pub2	The fourth parallel-group trial showed that eight weeks of treatment with flunisolide (500 mcg/day) was associated with a larger reduction in adenoid size than isotonic saline solution (P < 0.05).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006286.pub2	The fifth parallel-group trial demonstrated that eight weeks of treatment with fluticasone (400 mcg/day) significantly reduced nasal obstruction symptoms and adenoid size, and adenoidectomy was avoided in 76% of these patients compared with 20% of the patients treated with normal saline (P < 0.05).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006286.pub2	In contrast, one parallel-group trial did not find a significant improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms nor adenoid size after eight weeks of treatment with beclomethasone (200 mcg/day).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006286.pub2	Current evidence suggests that intranasal corticosteroids may significantly improve nasal obstruction symptoms in children with moderate to severe adenoidal hypertrophy, and this improvement may be associated with a reduction in adenoid size.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006286.pub2	The long-term efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in these patients remains to be defined.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	We included one small study (involving 24 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	The study was a single-centre randomised trial conducted in Mexico.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	This study compared a control group who received antihypertensive therapy, anticonvulsant therapy, plasma expanders, corticosteroids and dypyridamole with an intervention group that received epidural block instead of the antihypertensives, as well as all the other four drugs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	Lumbar epidural block was given using 0.25% bupivacaine, 10 mg bolus and 5 mg each hour on continuous epidural infusion for six hours.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	This study was at low risk of bias in three domains but was assessed to be high risk of bias in two domains due to lack of allocation concealment and blinding of women and staff, and unclear for random sequence generation and outcome assessor blinding.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	The included study did not report on any of this review's important outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	Meta-analysis was not possible.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	For the mother, these were: maternal death (death during pregnancy or up to 42 days after the end of the pregnancy, or death more than 42 days after the end of the pregnancy); development of eclampsia or recurrence of seizures; stroke; any serious morbidity: defined as at least one of stroke, kidney failure, liver failure, HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets), disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary oedema.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	For the baby, these were: death: stillbirths (death in utero at or after 20 weeks' gestation), perinatal deaths (stillbirths plus deaths in the first week of life), death before discharge from the hospital, neonatal deaths (death within the first 28 days after birth), deaths after the first 28 days; preterm birth (defined as the birth before 37 completed weeks' gestation); and side effects of the intervention.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	The included study only reported on a single secondary outcome of interest to this review: the Apgar score of the baby at birth and after five minutes and there was no clear difference between the intervention and control groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	The included study also reported a reduction in maternal diastolic arterial pressure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	However, the change in maternal mean arterial pressure and systolic arterial pressure, which were the other reported outcomes of this trial, were not significantly different between the two groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	Currently, there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness, safety or cost of using epidural therapy for treating severe pre-eclampsia in non-labouring women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	High-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the use of epidural agents as therapy for treatment of severe pre-eclampsia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	The rationale for the use of epidural is well-founded.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	However there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to show that the effect of epidural translates into improved maternal and fetal outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	Thus, there is a need for larger, well-designed studies to come to an evidence-based conclusion as to whether the lowering of vasomotor tone by epidural therapy results in better maternal and fetal outcomes and for how long that could be maintained.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	Another important question that needs to be answered is how long should extended epidural be used to ensure any potential clinical benefits and what could be the associated side effects and costs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009540.pub2	Interactions with other modalities of treatment and women's satisfaction could represent other avenues of research.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	Sixteen trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	All trials but one were at overall high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	Fifteen trials (one of which was an abstract) provided data for analysis (927 participants received glucocorticosteroids and 934 participants received placebo or no intervention).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	Glucocorticosteroids were administered orally or parenterally for a median 28 days (range 3 days to 12 weeks).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	The participants were between 25 and 70 years old, had different stages of alcoholic liver disease, and 65% were men.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	Follow-up, when reported, was up to the moment of discharge from the hospital, until they died (median of 63 days), or for at least one year.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	There was no evidence of effect of glucocorticosteroids on all-cause mortality up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.15; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence) or on health-related quality of life up to three months, measured with the European Quality of Life – 5	0

10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	There was no evidence of effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events during treatment (random-effects RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence), liver-related mortality up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence), number of participants with any complications up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; participants = 1861; very low-certainty evidence), and number of participants of non-serious adverse events up to three months' follow-up after end of treatment (random-effects RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 5.48; participants = 160; trials = 4; very low-certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	Based on the information that we collected from the published trial reports, only one of the trials seems not to be industry-funded, and the remaining 15 trials did not report clearly whether they were partly or completely funded by the industry.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	We are very uncertain about the effect estimate of no difference between glucocorticosteroids and placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality and serious adverse events during treatment because the certainty of evidence was very low, and low for health-related quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	Due to inadequate reporting, we cannot exclude increases in adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	As the CIs were wide, we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of glucocorticosteroids.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	Therefore, we need placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials, designed according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001511.pub4	Future trials ought to report depersonalised individual participant data, so that proper individual participant data meta-analyses of the effects of glucocorticosteroids in subgroups can be conducted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	We included four trials involving 245 participants in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	Study sample sizes were generally small, and interventions, controls and outcome measures varied, and thus it was inappropriate to pool studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	Included studies were at a low risk of bias for the majority of domains, with a high/unclear risk of bias identified in the areas of: performance (participants not blinded to allocation), and attrition (incomplete outcome data due to withdrawal) bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	Intervention approaches included the contextual approach of driving simulation and underlying skill development approach, including the retraining of speed of visual processing and visual motor skills.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	The studies were conducted with people who were relatively young and the timing after stroke was varied.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	Primary outcome: there was no clear evidence of improved on-road scores immediately after training in any of the four studies, or at six months (mean difference 15 points on the Test Ride for Investigating Practical Fitness to Drive - Belgian version, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 4.56 to 34.56, P value = 0.15, one study, 83 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	Secondary outcomes: road sign recognition was better in people who underwent training compared with control (mean difference 1.69 points on the Road Sign Recognition Task of the Stroke Driver Screening Assessment, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.87, P value = 0.007, one study, 73 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	Significant findings were in favour of a simulator-based driving rehabilitation programme (based on one study with 73 participants) but these results should be interpreted with caution as they were based on a single study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	Adverse effects were not reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effects on vision, other measures of cognition, motor and functional activities, and driving behaviour with the intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the use of rehabilitation to improve on-road driving skills after stroke.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	We found limited evidence that the use of a driving simulator may be beneficial in improving visuocognitive abilities, such as road sign recognition that are related to driving.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	Moreover, we were unable to find any RCTs that evaluated on-road driving lessons as an intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008357.pub2	At present, it is unclear which impairments that influence driving ability after stroke are amenable to rehabilitation, and whether the contextual or remedial approaches, or a combination of both, are more efficacious.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	Eight studies with 582 participants met the inclusion criteria, of which five studies conducted in hospitals with 519 participants (range 28 to 296) contributed to the meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	Mean ages of study participants were 65 to 73 years, the proportion of male participants varied (58% to 84%) and COPD was classified as severe or very severe.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	Corticosteroid treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	Five studies administered oral prednisolone (30 mg in four, tapered in one), and two studies provided intravenous corticosteroid treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	Studies contributing to the meta-analysis were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	In four studies we did not find a difference in risk of treatment failure between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.46)), which was equivalent to 22 fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 51 fewer to 34 more).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	No difference in risk of relapse (a new event) was observed between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.56), which was equivalent to nine fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 68 fewer to 100 more).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	Time to the next COPD exacerbation did not differ in one large study that was powered to detect non-inferiority and compared five days versus 14 days of systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 311; hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	In five studies no difference in the likelihood of an adverse event was found between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 503; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.69, or nine fewer per 1000 (95% CI 44 fewer to 51 more)).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	Length of hospital stay (n = 421; mean difference (MD) -0.61 days, 95% CI -1.51 to 0.28) and lung function at the end of treatment (n = 185; MD FEV1 -0.04 L; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10) did not differ between short-duration and longer-duration treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of oral corticosteroids is likely to be sufficient for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroids (of around five days) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer (10 to 14 days) courses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	We graded most available evidence as moderate in quality because of imprecision; further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect or may change the estimates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006897.pub4	The studies in this review did not include people with mild or moderate COPD; further studies comparing short-duration systemic corticosteroid versus conventional longer-duration systemic corticosteroid for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD are required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011577.pub2	We included one trial (13 participants) and identified three ongoing trials that assess RBC transfusion strategies in people with MDS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011577.pub2	The quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011577.pub2	The one included study randomised participants to a restrictive [haemoglobin (Hb) transfusion trigger < 72 g/L, 8 participants] or liberal [Hb trigger < 96 g/L, 5 participants] transfusion policy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011577.pub2	There was insufficient evidence to determine a difference in all-cause mortality (1 RCT; 13 participants; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.32; very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011577.pub2	There was insufficient evidence to determine a difference in the number of red blood cell transfusions (1 RCT; 13 participants; 1.8 units per patient per month in the liberal group, compared to 0.8 in the restrictive arm, no standard deviation was reported; very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011577.pub2	There were no anaemia-related complications reported (cardiac failure) and no reported effect on activity levels (no statistics provided).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011577.pub2	The study did not report: mortality due to bleeding/infection/transfusion reactions or iron overload, quality of life, frequency and length of hospital admissions, serious infections (requiring admission to hospital), or serious bleeding (e.g. WHO/CTCAE grade 3 (or equivalent) or above).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011577.pub2	This review indicates that there is currently a lack of evidence for the recommendation of a particular transfusion strategy for bone marrow failure patients undergoing supportive treatment only.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011577.pub2	The one RCT included in this review was only published as an abstract and contained only 13 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011577.pub2	Further randomised trials with robust methodology are required to develop the optimal transfusion strategy for such patients, particularly as the incidence of the main group of bone marrow failure disorders, MDS, rises with an ageing population.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD006411.pub4	The game evaluated in the first study used as a reinforcement technique, was based on the television game show "Family Feud" and focused on infection control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006411.pub4	The study did not assess any patient or process of care outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006411.pub4	The group that was randomized to the game had statistically higher scores on the knowledge test (P = 0.02).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006411.pub4	The second study compared game-based learning ("Snakes and Ladders" board game) with traditional case-based learning of stroke prevention and management.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006411.pub4	The effect on knowledge was not statistically different between the two groups immediately and 3 months after the intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006411.pub4	The level of reported enjoyment was higher in the game-based group.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD006411.pub4	There is a need for additional high-quality research to explore the impact of educational games on patient and performance outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003492.pub2	Eight trials involving 475 people were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003492.pub2	Two of the studies included a mixed group of participants with either bipolar or unipolar disorder.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003492.pub2	Relapse was defined as admission to hospital and when all kinds of relapses were considered (both depressive and manic), there was a statistically significant difference in favour of lithium (relative risk (RR) fixed effect 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.82).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003492.pub2	The results did not exclude the point of no effect, when the random-effects model was used (RR random effects 0.40, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.18).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003492.pub2	There were no other statistically significant differences between lithium and antidepressants according to all other outcomes considered.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003492.pub2	Manic or depressive relapse was defined as prescription of non-study medication for mood disorder, manic or depressive relapse (as defined by the study authors), quality of life, social functioning, occupational functioning, overall drop-out rate, drop-out rate due to side-effects, troublesome side-effects, mortality due to all causes and specifically suicides.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003492.pub2	There was adequate efficacy evidence for lithium or antidepressants preventing relapse in unipolar affective disorder, however their relative efficacy was unknown.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003492.pub2	When considering lithium or antidepressant long-term therapy, patients and clinicians should take into account the patient's clinical history, the side-effects and the individual's likely adherence to the recommended treatment regime.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003492.pub2	Large-scale, long-term randomised trials in unselected groups of subjects with unipolar affective disorder are needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007956.pub2	Two trials with 130 patients (67 and 63 patients randomised to intervention versus control) were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007956.pub2	Both studies had a low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007956.pub2	Amifostine versus placebo showed no statistically significant differences in the incidence of xerostomia (130 patients, two studies), the decrease of scintigraphically measured uptake of technetium-99m by salivary or submandibular glands at twelve months (80 patients, one study), and the reduction of blood pressure (130 patients, two studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007956.pub2	Two patients in one study collapsed after initiation of amifostine therapy and had to be treated by withdrawing the infusion and volume substitution.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007956.pub2	Both patients recovered without sequelae.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007956.pub2	Meta-analysis was not performed on the function of salivary glands measured by technetium-99m scintigraphy at three months after high dose radioactive iodine treatment due to the highly inconsistent findings across studies (I2 statistic 99%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007956.pub2	None of the included trials investigated death from any cause, morbidity, health-related quality of life or costs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007956.pub2	Results from two randomised controlled clinical trials suggest that the amifostine has no significant radioprotective effects on salivary glands in high-dose radioactive iodine treated differentiated thyroid cancer patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007956.pub2	Moreover, no health-related quality of life and other patient-oriented outcomes were evaluated in the two included trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007956.pub2	Randomised controlled clinical trials with low risk of bias investigating patient-oriented outcomes are needed to guide treatment choice.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	We included three studies involving 45 children aged between 29 months and six years with Down syndrome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	Two studies compared parent-mediated interventions versus TAU; the third compared a parent-mediated plus clinician-mediated intervention versus a clinician-mediated intervention alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	Treatment duration varied from 12 weeks to six months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	One study provided nine group sessions and four individualised home-based sessions over a 13-week period.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	Another study provided weekly, individual clinic-based or home-based sessions lasting 1.5 to 2 hours, over a six-month period.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	The third study provided one 2- to 3-hour group session followed by bi-weekly, individual clinic-based sessions plus once-weekly home-based sessions for 12 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	Because of the different study designs and outcome measures used, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	We judged all three studies to be at high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants (not possible due to the nature of the intervention) and blinding of outcome assessors, and at an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	We judged one study to be at unclear risk of selection bias, as authors did not report the methods used to generate the random sequence; at high risk of reporting bias, as they did not report on one assessed outcome; and at high risk of detection bias, as the control group had a cointervention and only parents in the intervention group were made aware of the target words for their children.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	The sample sizes of each included study were very small, meaning that they are unlikely to be representative of the target population.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	The findings from the three included studies were inconsistent.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	Two studies found no differences in expressive or receptive language abilities between the groups, whether measured by direct assessment or parent reports.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	However, they did find that children in the intervention group could use more targeted vocabulary items or utterances with language targets in certain contexts postintervention, compared to those in the control group; this was not maintained 12 months later.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	The third study found gains for the intervention group on total-language measures immediately postintervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	One study did not find any differences in parental stress scores between the groups at any time point up to 12 months postintervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	All three studies noted differences in most measures of how the parents talked to and interacted with their children postintervention, and in one study most strategies were maintained in the intervention group at 12 months postintervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	No study reported evidence of language attrition following the intervention in either group, while one study found positive outcomes on children's socialisation skills in the intervention group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	One study looked at adherence to the treatment through attendance data, finding that mothers in the intervention group attended seven out of nine group sessions and were present for four home visits.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	No study measured parental use of the strategies outside of the intervention sessions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	A grant from the Hospital for Sick Children Foundation (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) funded one study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	Another received partial funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education in the USA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	The remaining study did not specify any funding sources.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	In light of the serious limitations in methodology, and the small number of studies included, we considered the overall quality of the evidence, as assessed by GRADE, to be very low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	This means that we have very little confidence in the results, and further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effects of parent-mediated interventions for improving the language and communication of children with Down syndrome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	We found only three small studies of very low quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	This review highlights the need for well-designed studies, including RCTs, to evaluate the effectiveness of parent-mediated interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	Trials should use valid, reliable and similar measures of language development, and they should include measures of secondary outcomes more distal to the intervention, such as family well-being.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012089.pub2	Treatment fidelity, in particular parental dosage of the intervention outside of prescribed sessions, also needs to be documented.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010876.pub2	We included two trials from 1987 and 2004 with a total 148 participants who have had heart valve surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010876.pub2	Both trials had a high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010876.pub2	There was insufficient evidence at 3 to 6 months follow-up to judge the effect of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation compared to no exercise on mortality (RR 4.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 90.78); participants = 104; studies = 1; quality of evidence: very low) and on serious adverse events (RR 1.15 (95% CI 0.37 to 3.62); participants = 148; studies = 2; quality of evidence: very low).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010876.pub2	Included trials did not report on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and the secondary outcomes of New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction and cost.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010876.pub2	We did find that, compared with control (no exercise), exercise-based rehabilitation may increase exercise capacity (SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.13; participants = 140; studies = 2, quality of evidence: moderate).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010876.pub2	There was insufficient evidence at 12 months follow-up for the return to work outcome (RR 0.55 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.56); participants = 44; studies = 1; quality of evidence: low).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010876.pub2	Due to limited information, trial sequential analysis could not be performed as planned.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010876.pub2	Our findings suggest that exercise-based rehabilitation for adults after heart valve surgery, compared with no exercise, may improve exercise capacity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010876.pub2	Due to a lack of evidence, we cannot evaluate the impact on other outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010876.pub2	Further high-quality randomised clinical trials are needed in order to assess the impact of exercise-based rehabilitation on patient-relevant outcomes, including mortality and quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	Five RCTs (1130 participants) were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	Two studies evaluated meditation, the others evaluated multi-disciplinary palliative care interventions that involved a chaplain or spiritual counsellor as a member of the intervention team.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	The studies evaluating meditation found no overall significant difference between those receiving meditation or usual care on quality of life or well-being.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	However, when meditation was combined with massage in the medium term it buffered against a reduction in quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	In the palliative care intervention studies there was no significant difference in quality of life or well-being between the trial arms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	Coping with the disease was not evaluated in the studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	The quality of the studies was limited by under-reporting of design features.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	We found inconclusive evidence that interventions with spiritual or religious components for adults in the terminal phase of a disease may or may not enhance well-being.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	Such interventions are under-evaluated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	All five studies identified were undertaken in the same country, and in the multi-disciplinary palliative care interventions it is unclear if all participants received support from a chaplain or a spiritual counsellor.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	Moreover, it is unclear in all the studies whether the participants in the comparative groups received spiritual or religious support, or both, as part of routine care or from elsewhere.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007544.pub2	The paucity of quality research indicates a need for more rigorous studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	We included six trials with a total of 137 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	We found two studies with 45 participants examining the effects of tDCS compared to control (sham tDCS) on our primary outcome measure, impairment, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	There was very low quality evidence for no effect of tDCS on change in global UPDRS score ( mean difference (MD) -7.10 %, 95% confidence interval (CI -19.18 to 4.97; P = 0.25, I² = 21%, random-effects model).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	However, there was evidence of an effect on UPDRS part III motor subsection score at the end of the intervention phase (MD -14.43%, 95% CI -24.68 to -4.18; P = 0.006, I² = 2%, random-effects model; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	One study with 25 participants measured the reduction in off and on time with dyskinesia, but there was no evidence of an effect (MD 0.10 hours, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.34; P = 0.41, I² = 0%, random-effects model; and MD 0.00 hours, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.12; P = 1, I² = 0%, random- effects model, respectively; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	Two trials with a total of 41 participants measured gait speed using measures of timed gait at the end of the intervention phase, revealing no evidence of an effect ( standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.50, 95% CI -0.17 to 1.18; P = 0.14, I² = 11%, random-effects model; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	Another secondary outcome was health-related quality of life and we found one study with 25 participants reporting on the physical health and mental health aspects of health-related quality of life (MD 1.00 SF-12 score, 95% CI -5.20 to 7.20; I² = 0%, inverse variance method with random-effects model; very low quality evidence; and MD 1.60 SF-12 score, 95% CI -5.08 to 8.28; I² = 0%, inverse variance method with random-effects model; very low quality evidence, respectively).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	We found no study examining the effects of tDCS for improving activities of daily living.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	In two of six studies, dropouts , adverse events, or deaths occurring during the intervention phase were reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	There was insufficient evidence that dropouts , adverse effects, or deaths were higher with intervention (risk difference (RD) 0.04, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.12; P = 0.40, I² = 0%, random-effects model; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	We found one trial with a total of 16 participants examining the effects of tDCS plus movement therapy compared to control (sham tDCS) plus movement therapy on our secondary outcome, gait speed at the end of the intervention phase, revealing no evidence of an effect (MD 0.05 m/s, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.25; inverse variance method with random-effects model; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	We found no evidence of an effect regarding differences in dropouts and adverse effects between intervention and control groups (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.21; Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects model; very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of tDCS for reducing off time ( when the symptoms are not controlled by the medication) and on time with dyskinesia ( time that symptoms are controlled but the person still experiences involuntary muscle movements ) , and for improving health- related quality of life, disability, and impairment in patients with IPD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010916.pub2	Evidence of very low quality indicates no difference in dropouts and adverse events between tDCS and control groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	We included an additional four studies (N = 154) in this update.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	For this update, we excluded studies that did not follow up patients for more than 48 hours.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	As a result, we excluded four studies from the previous review in this update.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	Overall we included 12 studies (N = 461), all of which we judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	Overall, the quality of evidence was low to very low, downgraded due to limitations, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or a combination of these.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	Two small studies compared LASB to placebo/sham (N = 32).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	They did not demonstrate significant short-term benefit for LASB for pain intensity (moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	One small study (N = 36) at high risk of bias compared thoracic sympathetic block with corticosteroid and local anaesthetic versus injection of the same agents into the subcutaneous space, reporting statistically significant and clinically important differences in pain intensity at one-year follow-up but not at short term follow-up (very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	Of two studies that investigated LASB as an addition to rehabilitation treatment, the only study that reported pain outcomes demonstrated no additional benefit from LASB (very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	Eight small randomised studies compared sympathetic blockade to various other active interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	Most studies found no difference in pain outcomes between sympathetic block versus other active treatments (low to very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	One small study compared ultrasound-guided LASB with non-guided LASB and found no clinically important difference in pain outcomes (very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	Six studies reported adverse events, all with minor effects reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	This update's results are similar to the previous versions of this systematic review, and the main conclusions are unchanged.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	There remains a scarcity of published evidence and a lack of high quality evidence to support or refute the use of local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for CRPS.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004598.pub4	From the existing evidence, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of this intervention, but the limited data available do not suggest that LASB is effective for reducing pain in CRPS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Fourteen trials, including 2488 participants, met the inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Most were small, and most were at high or unclear risk of bias in multiple domains.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	We included four new studies at this update.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Incomplete recovery	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	A combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may have little or no effect on rates of incomplete recovery in people with Bell's palsy compared to corticosteroids alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.74; 3 trials, N = 766; random-effects; low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	We excluded 10 trials that were at high or unclear risk of bias in several domains from this analysis and limited all analyses to studies at lower risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Recovery rates were better in participants receiving corticosteroids alone than antivirals alone (RR 2.69, 95% CI 0.73 to 10.01; 2 trials, N = 667; random-effects), but the result was imprecise and allowed for the possibility of no effect.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	The rate of incomplete recovery was lower with antivirals plus corticosteroids than with placebo or no treatment (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.76; 2 trials, N = 658; random-effects).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Antivirals alone had no clear effect on incomplete recovery rates compared with placebo, but the result was imprecise (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.40; 2 trials, N = 658; fixed-effect).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	For people with severe Bell's palsy (House-Brackmann score of 5 and 6, or equivalent on other scales), we found that the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids had no clear effect on incomplete recovery at month six compared to corticosteroids alone, although the result was again imprecise (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.17; 2 trials, N = 98; random-effects).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Motor synkinesis or crocodile tears	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Antivirals plus corticosteroids reduced the proportion of participants who experienced these long-term sequelae from Bell's palsy compared to placebo plus corticosteroids (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 2 trials, N = 469; fixed-effect; moderate-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Antivirals plus corticosteroids reduced long-term sequelae compared to placebo but there was no clear difference in this outcome with antivirals alone compared to placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Adverse events	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Adverse event data were available in four studies providing data on 1592 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	None of the four comparisons showed clear differences in adverse events between treatment and comparison arms (very low-certainty evidence); for the comparison of antivirals plus corticosteroids and corticosteroids alone in studies at lower risk of bias, the RR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.69; 2 trials, N = 656; fixed-effect; very low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may have little or no effect on rates of incomplete recovery in comparison to corticosteroids alone in Bell's palsy of various degrees of severity, or in people with severe Bell's palsy, but the results were very imprecise.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Corticosteroids alone were probably more effective than antivirals alone and antivirals plus corticosteroids were more effective than placebo or no treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	There was no clear benefit from antivirals alone over placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids probably reduced the late sequelae of Bell's palsy compared with corticosteroids alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	Studies also showed fewer episodes of long-term sequelae in corticosteroid-treated participants than antiviral-treated participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	We found no clear difference in adverse events from the use of antivirals compared with either placebo or corticosteroids, but the evidence is too uncertain for us to draw conclusions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub9	An adequately powered RCT in people with Bell’s palsy that compares different antiviral agents may be indicated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	Two studies, including 97 women, met our inclusion criteria: one assessed LHRH agonist (leuprorelin) use in relapsed (platinum-resistant and platinum-refractory) EOC in comparison with a chemotherapeutic agent (treosulfan) (Du Bois 2002); the other examined LHRH agonist (decapeptyl) versus a placebo (Currie 1994).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	Since both studies had different control groups, a meta-analysis was not possible.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	There may be little or no difference between treatment with leuprorelin or treosulfan in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 1.67; very low-quality evidence) or progression-free survival (PFS) at six and 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.68, and RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.66; very low-quality evidence), respectively (Du Bois 2002).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	The duration of follow-up was 2.5 years and quality of life (QoL) was not reported in this study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	Alopecia and fatigue were probably more common with treosulfan than leuprorelin (alopecia RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.91 (very low-quality evidence)).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	There may be little or no difference in other Grade 3/4 side effects: nausea and vomiting (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.66 (very low-quality evidence)); neurotoxicity (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.71 (very low-quality evidence)) and neutropenia (RR 0.97, 95% 0.06 to 14.97 (very low-quality evidence)), The Currie 1994 study, which compared decapeptyl treatment with placebo, reported mean PFS of 16 weeks verus 11.2 weeks, respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	No relative effects measures or P value at a particular time point were reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	Overall survival (OS) and QoL outcomes were not reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	In addition, adverse events were only mentioned for the decapeptyl group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	Adverse events were incompletely reported (no adverse events in decapeptyl group, but not reported for the placebo group).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	Based on this review of two small RCTs, there is not enough evidence to comment on the safety and effectiveness of LHRH agonists in the treatment of platinum-refractory and platinum-resistant (relapsed) EOC.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011322.pub2	Overall, the quality of evidence for all outcomes (including OS, PFS, QoL and adverse events) is very low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	We found 17 eligible randomised controlled studies that included term and near-term infants with hypoxia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Ten trials compared iNO versus control (placebo or standard care without iNO) in infants with moderate or severe severity of illness scores (Ninos 1996; Roberts 1996; Wessel 1996; Davidson 1997; Ninos 1997; Mercier 1998; Christou 2000; Clark 2000; INNOVO 2007; Liu 2008).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Mercier 1998 compared iNO versus control but allowed back-up treatment with iNO for infants who continued to satisfy the same criteria for severity of illness after two hours.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	This trial enrolled both preterm and term infants but reported most results separately for the two groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Ninos 1997 studied only infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	One trial compared iNO versus high-frequency ventilation (Kinsella 1997).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Six trials enrolled infants with moderate severity of illness scores (oxygenation index (OI) or alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2)) and randomised them to immediate iNO treatment or iNO treatment only after deterioration to more severe criteria (Barefield 1996; Day 1996; Sadiq 1998; Cornfield 1999; Konduri 2004; Gonzalez 2010).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Inhaled nitric oxide appears to have improved outcomes in hypoxaemic term and near-term infants by reducing the incidence of the combined endpoint of death or use of ECMO (high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	This reduction was due to a reduction in use of ECMO (with number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 5.3); mortality was not affected.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Oxygenation was improved in approximately 50% of infants receiving iNO.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	The OI was decreased by a (weighted) mean of 15.1 within 30 to 60 minutes after the start of therapy, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) was increased by a mean of 53 mmHg.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Whether infants had clear echocardiographic evidence of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) did not appear to affect response to iNO.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Outcomes of infants with diaphragmatic hernia were not improved; outcomes were slightly, but not significantly, worse with iNO (moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Infants who received iNO at less severe criteria did not have better clinical outcomes than those who were enrolled but received treatment only if their condition deteriorated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Fewer of the babies who received iNO early satisfied late treatment criteria, showing that earlier iNO reduced progression of the disease but did not further decrease mortality nor the need for ECMO (moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Incidence of disability, incidence of deafness and infant development scores were all similar between tested survivors who received iNO and those who did not.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3	Inhaled nitric oxide is effective at an initial concentration of 20 ppm for term and near-term infants with hypoxic respiratory failure who do not have a diaphragmatic hernia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001823.pub3	Seven preventive studies (14,437 people) and eight treatment studies (1361 people) were included in this updated review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001823.pub3	Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was rather low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001823.pub3	Only five of the fifteen studies met 50% or more of the internal validity items.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001823.pub3	There was moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether lumbar supports are effective supplements to other preventive interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001823.pub3	It is still unclear if lumbar supports are more effective than no or other interventions for the treatment of low-back pain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001823.pub3	There is moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether they are effective supplements to other preventive interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001823.pub3	It remains unclear whether lumbar supports are more effective than no or other interventions for treating low-back pain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001823.pub3	There is still a need for high quality randomised trials on the effectiveness of lumbar supports.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001823.pub3	One of the most essential issues to tackle in these future trials seems to be the realization of an adequate compliance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001823.pub3	Special attention should be paid to different outcome measures, types of patients and types of lumbar support.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	We included one new study (338 participants/catheters) in this update, which brought the total included to 57 studies with 16,784 catheters and 11 types of impregnations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	The total number of participants enrolled was unclear, as some studies did not provide this information.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	Most studies enrolled participants from the age of 18, including patients in intensive care units (ICU), oncology units and patients receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	There were low or unclear risks of bias in the included studies, except for blinding, which was impossible in most studies due to the catheters that were being assessed having different appearances.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	Overall, catheter impregnation significantly reduced catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI), with an ARR of 2% (95% CI 3% to 1%), RR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.74) and NNTB of 50 (high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	Catheter impregnation also reduced catheter colonization, with an ARR of 9% (95% CI 12% to 7%), RR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.76) and NNTB of 11 (moderate-quality evidence, downgraded due to substantial heterogeneity).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	However, catheter impregnation made no significant difference to the rates of clinically diagnosed sepsis (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; moderate-quality evidence, downgraded due to a suspicion of publication bias), all-cause mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07; high-quality evidence) and catheter-related local infections (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.07; 2688 catheters, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to wide 95% CI).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	In our subgroup analyses, we found that the magnitudes of benefits for impregnated CVCs varied between studies that enrolled different types of participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	For the outcome of catheter colonization, catheter impregnation conferred significant benefit in studies conducted in ICUs (RR 0.70;95% CI 0.61 to 0.80) but not in studies conducted in haematological and oncological units (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.11) or studies that assessed predominantly patients who required CVCs for long-term total parenteral nutrition (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.34).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	However, there was no such variation for the outcome of CRBSI.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	The magnitude of the effects was also not affected by the participants' baseline risks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	There were no significant differences between the impregnated and non-impregnated groups in the rates of adverse effects, including thrombosis/thrombophlebitis, bleeding, erythema and/or tenderness at the insertion site.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	This review confirms the effectiveness of antimicrobial CVCs in reducing rates of CRBSI and catheter colonization.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	However, the magnitude of benefits regarding catheter colonization varied according to setting, with significant benefits only in studies conducted in ICUs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	A comparatively smaller body of evidence suggests that antimicrobial CVCs do not appear to reduce clinically diagnosed sepsis or mortality significantly.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	Our findings call for caution in routinely recommending the use of antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs across all settings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007878.pub3	Further randomized controlled trials assessing antimicrobial CVCs should include important clinical outcomes like the overall rates of sepsis and mortality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	The systematic review included 15 studies, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	The interventions took place in recognised slums or poor urban or periurban areas.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	All the studies identified were nutrient supplementation and educational interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	The interventions included zinc supplementation in pregnant women (three studies), micronutrient or macronutrient supplementation in children (eight studies), nutrition education for pregnant women (two studies), and nutrition systems strengthening targeting children (two studies) intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	Six interventions were adapted to the urban context and seven targeted household, community, or 'service delivery' via systems strengthening.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	The primary review outcomes were available from seven studies for LFA/HFA, four for LBW, and nine for length.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	The studies had overall high risk of bias for 11 studies and only four RCTs had moderate risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	Overall, the evidence was complex to report, with a wide range of outcome measures reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	Consequently, only eight study findings were reported in meta-analyses and seven in a narrative form.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate overall.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	Nutrition systems strengthening interventions targeting children (compared with no intervention, standard care) (one RCT and one controlled before-and-after study)	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	There were inconclusive results on HFA, with very low- to low-certainty evidence, and a positive influence on length at 18 months, with low-certainty evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	All the nutritional interventions reviewed had the potential to decrease stunting, based on evidence from outside of slum contexts; however, there was no evidence of an effect of the interventions included in this review (very low- to moderate-certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	Challenges linked to urban slum programming (high mobility, lack of social services, and high loss of follow-up) should be taken into account when nutrition-specific interventions are proposed to address LBW and stunting in such environments.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011695.pub2	More evidence is needed of the effects of multi-sectorial interventions, combining nutrition-specific and sensitive methods and programmes, as well as the effects of 'up-stream' practices and policies of governmental, non-governmental organisations, and the business sector on nutrition-related outcomes such as stunting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009907.pub2	Twelve RCTs (1023 participants) reporting 14 comparisons were included in this review.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD009907.pub2	Pooled data across five RCTs (418 participants) showed no statistically significant difference between foam dressings and hydrocolloid dressings in the proportion of ulcers healed at 12 to 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.22).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009907.pub2	No statistically significant between-group differences in healing outcomes were detected when foam dressings were compared with: paraffin gauze (two RCTs); hydrocapillary dressing (one RCT); knitted viscose dressing (one RCT); and protease modulating matrix (one RCT).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009907.pub2	No statistically significant between-group differences in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events were detected when hydrocellular foam dressings were compared with polyurethane foam dressings, or when foam dressings were compared with hydrocapillary, hydrocolloid, or knitted viscose dressings (one RCT for each comparison).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009907.pub2	Six RCTs were considered as being at overall high risk of bias, and the remaining six RCTs were considered to be at overall unclear risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009907.pub2	No included RCT had an overall low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009907.pub2	The current evidence base does not suggest that foam dressings are more effective in the healing of venous leg ulcers than other wound dressing treatments.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD009907.pub2	Further evidence is required from well-designed and rigorously-conducted RCTs, that employ methods to minimise bias and report them clearly, before any definitive conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of foam dressings in the management of venous leg ulcers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	There were no RCTs that assessed the tolerability or safety of the withdrawn COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib, valdecoxib, or lumiracoxib.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	Two RCTs (n = 381 IBD patients with rheumatological manifestations) were included in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	One study (n = 159) compared etoricoxib (60 to 120 mg/day) to placebo in IBD patients with quiescent or active ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	The other study (n = 222) compared celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) to placebo in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	Both studies were judged to be at low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	The two included studies were not pooled for meta-analysis due to differences in patient populations and treatment duration.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	There was no statistically significant difference in exacerbation of IBD between etoricoxib and placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	After 12 weeks of treatment the IBD exacerbation rate was 17% (14/82) in the etoricoxib group compared to 19% (15/77) in the placebo group (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.69).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (29 events).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	There was no statistically significant difference in exacerbation of ulcerative colitis between celecoxib and placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	After two weeks of treatment 4% (5/112) of celecoxib patients experienced an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis compared to 6% (7/110) of patients in the placebo group (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.14).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (12 events).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	The study comparing etoricoxib to placebo documented but did not report on AEs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	The proportion of patients who experienced AEs was similar in the celecoxib and placebo groups (21% and 17%, respectively, P > 0.20).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	No patients in either group died or experienced serious adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	Eleven percent of patients in the celecoxib and placebo groups experienced GI AEs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.07).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (24 events).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	GI AEs led to premature withdrawal from the study in 3% of patients in celecoxib and placebo groups respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	GI AEs included increased stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and inflamed mucosa.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	No patients experienced any cardiovascular adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	Renal toxicity or thrombotic AEs were not reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	The results for disease exacerbation and AEs between the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and etoricoxib and placebo were uncertain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	Thus no definitive conclusions regarding the tolerability and safety of the short term use of celecoxib and etoricoxib in patients with IBD can be drawn.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	The two included studies suggest that celecoxib and etoricoxib do not exacerbate IBD symptoms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	However, it should be noted that both studies had relatively small sample sizes and short follow-up durations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	Clinicians need to continue to weigh the risks and benefits of these drugs when treating patients IBD patients with rheumatological manifestations in order to avoid disease exacerbation and other adverse effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007744.pub2	Further RCTs are needed to determine the tolerability and safety of celecoxib and etoricoxib in these patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	We found 22 trials that met our inclusion criteria with a total of over 2310 participants (one study did not report number of participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	The included studies mostly had small numbers of participants (from 4 to 317) and relatively short follow-up periods (4 to 24 weeks).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	At baseline, six trials included only people with ulcers that were clinically infected; one trial included people with both infected and uninfected ulcers; two trials included people with non-infected ulcers; and the remaining 13 studies did not report infection status.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	Included studies employed various topical antimicrobial treatments, including antimicrobial dressings (e.g. silver, iodides), super-oxidised aqueous solutions, zinc hyaluronate, silver sulphadiazine, tretinoin, pexiganan cream, and chloramine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	We performed the following five comparisons based on the included studies:	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	Antimicrobial dressings compared with non-antimicrobial dressings: Pooled data from five trials with a total of 945 participants suggest (based on the average treatment effect from a random-effects model) that more wounds may heal when treated with an antimicrobial dressing than with a non-antimicrobial dressing: risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.45.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	These results correspond to an additional 119 healing events in the antimicrobial-dressing arm per 1000 participants (95% CI 51 to 191 more).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	We consider this low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice due to risk of bias).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	The evidence on adverse events or other outcomes was uncertain (very low-certainty evidence, frequently downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	Antimicrobial topical treatments (non dressings) compared with non-antimicrobial topical treatments (non dressings):	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	There were four trials with a total of 132 participants in this comparison that contributed variously to the estimates of outcome data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	Evidence was generally of low or very low certainty, and the 95% CIs spanned benefit and harm: proportion of wounds healed RR 2.82 (95% CI 0.56 to 14.23; 112 participants; 3 trials; very low-certainty evidence); achieving resolution of infection RR 1.16 (95% CI 0.54 to 2.51; 40 participants; 1 trial; low-certainty evidence); undergoing surgical resection RR 1.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 5.90; 40 participants; 1 trial; low-certainty evidence); and sustaining an adverse event (no events in either arm; 81 participants; 2 trials; very low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	Comparison of different topical antimicrobial treatments:	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	We included eight studies with a total of 250 participants, but all of the comparisons were different and no data could be appropriately pooled.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	Reported outcome data were limited and we are uncertain about the relative effects of antimicrobial topical agents for each of our review outcomes for this comparison, that is wound healing, resolution of infection, surgical resection, and adverse events (all very low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	Topical antimicrobials compared with systemic antibiotics :	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	We included four studies with a total of 937 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	These studies reported no wound-healing data, and the evidence was uncertain for the relative effects on resolution of infection in infected ulcers and surgical resection (very low certainty).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	On average, there is probably little difference in the risk of adverse events between the compared topical antimicrobial and systemic antibiotics treatments: RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; moderate-certainty evidence - downgraded once for inconsistency).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	Topical antimicrobial agents compared with growth factor:	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	We included one study with 40 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	The only review-relevant outcome reported was number of ulcers healed, and these data were uncertain (very low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	The randomised controlled trial data on the effectiveness and safety of topical antimicrobial treatments for diabetic foot ulcers is limited by the availability of relatively few, mostly small, and often poorly designed trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	Based on our systematic review and analysis of the literature, we suggest that: 1) use of an antimicrobial dressing instead of a non-antimicrobial dressing may increase the number of diabetic foot ulcers healed over a medium-term follow-up period (low-certainty evidence); and 2) there is probably little difference in the risk of adverse events related to treatment between systemic antibiotics and topical antimicrobial treatments based on the available studies (moderate-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	For each of the other outcomes we examined there were either no reported data or the available data left us uncertain as to whether or not there were any differences between the compared treatments.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011038.pub2	Given the high, and increasing, frequency of diabetic foot wounds, we encourage investigators to undertake properly designed randomised controlled trials in this area to evaluate the effects of topical antimicrobial treatments for both the prevention and the treatment of infection in these wounds and ultimately the effects on wound healing.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005978.pub3	We did not identify any new studies for inclusion in this update.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005978.pub3	We included six studies that involved 5193 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005978.pub3	Analysis showed that zinc supplementation reduced the incidence of pneumonia by 13% (fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.94, six studies, low-quality evidence) and prevalence of pneumonia by 41% (random-effects RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, one study, n = 609, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005978.pub3	On subgroup analysis, we found that zinc reduced the incidence of pneumonia defined by specific clinical criteria by 21% (i.e. confirmation by chest examination or chest radiograph) (fixed-effect RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88, four studies, n = 3261), but had no effect on lower specificity pneumonia case definition (i.e. age-specific fast breathing with or without lower chest indrawing) (fixed-effect RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06, four studies, n = 1932).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005978.pub3	Zinc supplementation in children is associated with a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of pneumonia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006090.pub2	Ten studies including 33,179 participants were included in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006090.pub2	Eight studies found no significant effect of vitamin A on the incidence of acute LRTI, or prevalence of symptoms of acute LRTI.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006090.pub2	Vitamin A caused an increased incidence of acute LRTI in one study; an increase in cough and fever; and increased symptoms of cough and rapid breathing in two other studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006090.pub2	Three reported no differences and no protective effect of vitamin A.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006090.pub2	Two studies reported that vitamin A significantly reduced the incidence of acute LRTI in children with poor nutritional status or weight, but increased the incidence in healthy children.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006090.pub2	This unexpected result is outside our current understanding of the use of vitamin A for preventing acute LRTIs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006090.pub2	Accordingly, vitamin A should not be given to all children to prevent acute LRTIs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006090.pub2	Despite its benefits in preventing diarrhoeal illnesses, vitamin A supplementation has only a limited effect in preventing acute LRTIs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006090.pub2	Positive effects appear limited to populations with acute and chronic under nutrition.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006090.pub2	Low-dose vitamin A appears to have fewer side effects and at least equal benefit to a high dose of vitamin A.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	Twenty RCTs met the inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	Concomitant therapy varied from none to any other bronchodilator plus corticosteroid (oral and inhaled).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	The following outcomes were significantly different when compared to placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) improved with treatment: Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 100 ml; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 40 to 160 ml. Similarly for forced vital capacity (FVC): WMD 210 ml 95%CI 100 to 320.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	Two studies reported an improvement in maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max); WMD 195 ml/min, 95%CI 113 to 278.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	At rest, arterial oxygen tension at rest (PaO2) and arterial carbon dioxide tension at rest (PaCO2) both improved with treatment (WMD 3.2 mm Hg; 95%CI 1.2 to 5.1, and WMD -2.4 mm Hg; 95%CI -3.5 to -1.2, respectively).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	Walking distance tests did not improve (four studies, Standardised Mean Difference 0.30, 95%CI -0.01 to 0.62), neither did Visual Analogue Score for breathlessness in two small studies (WMD 3.6, 95%CI -4.6 to 11.8).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	The Relative Risk (RR) of nausea was greater with theophylline (RR 7.7; 95%CI 1.5 to 39.9).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	However, patients' preference for theophylline was greater than that for placebo (RR 2.27; 95%CI 1.26 to 4.11).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	Very few participants withdrew from these studies for any reason.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	Theophylline has a modest effect on FEV1 and FVC and slightly improves arterial blood gas tensions in moderate to severe COPD.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	These benefits were seen in participants receiving a variety of different concomitant therapies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	Improvement in exercise performance depended on the method of testing.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	There was a very low dropout rate in the studies that could be included in this review, which suggests that recruited participants may have been known by the investigators to be theophylline tolerant .	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003902	This may limit the generalisability of these studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	We included 10 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria, that involved a total of 439 children (oral immunotherapy 249; control intervention 190), aged 1 year to 18 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Each study used a different oral immunotherapy protocol; none used sublingual immunotherapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Three studies used placebo and seven used an egg avoidance diet as the control.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Primary outcomes were: an increased amount of egg that can be ingested and tolerated without adverse events while receiving allergen-specific oral immunotherapy or sublingual immunotherapy, compared to control; and a complete recovery from egg allergy after completion of oral immunotherapy or sublingual immunotherapy, compared to control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Most children (82%) in the oral immunotherapy group could ingest a partial serving of egg (1 g to 7.5 g) compared to 10% of control group children (RR 7.48, 95% CI 4.91 to 11.38; RD 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Fewer than half (45%) of children receiving oral immunotherapy were able to tolerate a full serving of egg compared to 10% of the control group (RR 4.25, 95% CI 2.77 to 6.53; RD 0.35, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.43).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	All 10 trials reported numbers of children with serious adverse events (SAEs) and numbers of children with mild-to-severe adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	SAEs requiring epinephrine/adrenaline presented in 21/249 (8.4%) of children in the oral immunotherapy group, and none in the control group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Mild-to-severe adverse events were frequent; 75% of children presented mild-to-severe adverse events during oral immunotherapy treatment versus 6.8% of the control group (RR 8.35, 95% CI 5.31 to 13.12).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Of note, seven studies used an egg avoidance diet as the control.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Adverse events occurred in 4.2% of children, which may relate to accidental ingestion of egg-containing food.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Three studies used a placebo control with adverse events present in 2.6% of children.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Overall, there was inconsistent methodological rigour in the trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	All studies enrolled small numbers of children and used different methods to provide oral immunotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Eight included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Furthermore, the quality of evidence was judged to be low due to small numbers of participants and events, and possible biases.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	Frequent and increasing exposure to egg over one to two years in people who are allergic to egg builds tolerance, with almost everyone becoming more tolerant compared with a minority in the control group and almost half of people being totally tolerant of egg by the end of treatment compared with 1 in 10 people who avoid egg.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	However, nearly all who received treatment experienced adverse events, mainly allergy-related.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	We found that 1 in 12 children had serious allergic reactions requiring adrenaline, and some people gave up oral immunotherapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3	It appears that oral immunotherapy for egg allergy is effective, but confidence in the trade-off between benefits and harms is low; because there was a small number of trials with few participants, and methodological problems with some trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	We included four trials involving a total of 579 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	With the limitation that only two studies reported data on mortality and none of them had considered death as a primary endpoint, the meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference in the risk of long-term mortality between participants who received ILR and those who were managed conventionally at follow-up (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.30; participants = 255; studies = 2; very low quality evidence) with no evidence of heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	No data on short term mortality were available.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	Two studies reported data on adverse events after ILR implant.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	Due to the lack of data on adverse events in one of the studies' arms, a formal meta-analysis was not performed for this outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	Data from two trials seemed to show no difference in quality of life, although this finding was not supported by a formal analysis due to the differences in both the scores used and the way the data were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	Data from two studies seemed to show a trend towards a reduction in syncope relapses after diagnosis in participants implanted with ILR.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	Cost analyses from two studies showed higher overall mean costs in the ILR group, if the costs incurred by the ILR implant were counted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	The mean cost per diagnosis and the mean cost per arrhythmic diagnosis were lower for participants randomised to ILR implant.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	Participants who underwent ILR implantation experienced higher rates of diagnosis (RR (in favour of ILR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; participants = 579; studies = 4; moderate quality evidence), as compared to participants in the standard assessment group, with no evidence of heterogeneity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	Our systematic review shows that there is no evidence that an ILR-based diagnostic strategy reduces long-term mortality as compared to a standard diagnostic assessment (very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	No data were available for short-term all-cause mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	Moderate quality evidence shows that an ILR-based diagnostic strategy increases the rate of aetiologic diagnosis as compared to a standard diagnostic pathway.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	No conclusive data were available on the other end-points analysed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	Further trials evaluating the effect of ILRs in the diagnostic strategy of people with recurrent unexplained syncope are warranted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011637.pub2	Future research should focus on the assessment of the ability of ILRs to change clinically relevant outcomes, such as quality of life, syncope relapse and costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	We found four small studies that met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	These studies enrolled 275 patients with 282 hydroceles.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	Participants were randomised to aspiration and sclerotherapy (155 patients with 159 hydroceles) and surgery (120 patients with 123 hydroceles).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and selective reporting bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	Blinding was not possible for participants and investigators based on the type of interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	Blinding for statisticians was not reported in any of included studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	There were no significant difference in clinical cure between the two groups (3 studies, 215 participants: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.10), however there was significant heterogeneity (I² = 95%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	On further investigation one study contributed all of the heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	This could be due to the agent used or perhaps due to the fact that this is a much older study than the other two studies included in this analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	When this study was removed from the analysis the heterogeneity was 0% and the result was significant (in favour of surgery) (2 studies, 136 participants: RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	There was a significant increase in recurrence in those who received sclerotherapy compared with surgery (3 studies, 196 participants: RR 9.37, 95% CI 1.83 to 48.4).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	One study reported a non-significant decrease in fever in the sclerotherapy group (60 participants: RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.08).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	There was an increased number of infections in the surgery group however this increase was not statistically significant (4 studies, 275 participants): RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.05; I² = 0%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	Three studies reported the frequency of pain in the surgery group was higher than aspiration and sclerotherapy group but because of different measurement tools applied in these studies, we could not pool the results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	Radiological cure was not reported in any of the included studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	There was no significant difference in haematoma formation between the two groups (3 studies, 189 participants: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.90; I² = 0%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	Only one study reported patient satisfaction at three and six months; there was no significant difference between the two groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	Postoperative complications as well as cost and time to work resumption were less in the aspiration and sclerotherapy group; however the recurrence rate was higher.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	The cure rate in short-term follow-up was similar between the groups, however there is significant uncertainty in this result due to the high heterogeneity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	There is a great need for further methodologically rigorous RCTs that assess the effectiveness of different type of sclerosant agents, sclerosing solution concentration and injection volume for the treatment of hydrocoeles.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	It is important that the RCTs have sufficiently large sample size and long follow-up period.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	Studies should evaluate clinical outcomes such as pain, recurrence, satisfaction, complications and cure using validated instruments.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	The protocols for all studies should be registered in clinical trial registries and the reports of these studies should conform with international guidelines of trial reporting such as CONSORT.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009735.pub2	Cost-effectiveness studies should also be undertaken.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	We included one RCT that compared nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) with placebo in 40 children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	We assessed it to be a RCT with overall low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	Data analysed in this review showed that there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of proportion cough-free at two weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 5.14).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	However, the mean change in night time cough diary scores significantly favoured the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.83, P = 0.02).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	The mean change in daytime cough diary scores from baseline was also better in the placebo group compared to those on nebulised rhDNase, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (MD 0.70; 95% CI -0.19 to 1.59).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	Other outcomes (dyspnoea, and difficulty in expectorating sputum scores, and lung function tests at two weeks also favoured placebo over nebulised rhDNase but did not reach levels of significance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	There is currently an absence of evidence to support any of the therapies currently utilised for management of intrinsic tracheomalacia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	It remains inconclusive whether the use of nebulised rhDNase in children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection worsens recovery.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life-threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	For those with less severe disease, RCTs on interventions such as antibiotics and chest physiotherapy are clearly needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005304.pub3	Outcomes of these RCTs should include measurements of the trachea and physiological outcomes in addition to clinical outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	We included 21 studies with 2658 randomised participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	All studies assessed the effectiveness of some form of psychological therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	We found no studies that included physical therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Fourteen studies evaluated forms of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); the remainder evaluated behaviour therapies, third-wave CBT (mindfulness), psychodynamic therapies, and integrative therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Fifteen included studies compared the studied psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Five studies compared the intervention to enhanced or structured care.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Only one study compared cognitive behavioural therapy with behaviour therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Across the 21 studies, the mean number of sessions ranged from one to 13, over a period of one day to nine months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Duration of follow-up varied between two weeks and 24 months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Participants were recruited from various healthcare settings and the open population.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Duration of symptoms, reported by nine studies, was at least several years, suggesting most participants had chronic symptoms at baseline.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Due to the nature of the intervention, lack of blinding of participants, therapists, and outcome assessors resulted in a high risk of bias on these items for most studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Eleven studies (52% of studies) reported a loss to follow-up of more than 20%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	For other items, most studies were at low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Adverse events were seldom reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	For all studies comparing some form of psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list that could be included in the meta-analysis, the psychological therapy resulted in less severe symptoms at end of treatment (SMD -0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.53 to -0.16; 10 studies, 1081 analysed participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	This effect was considered small to medium; heterogeneity was moderate and overall quality of the evidence was low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Compared with usual care, psychological therapies resulted in a 7% higher proportion of drop-outs during treatment (RR acceptability 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99; 14 studies, 1644 participants; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Removing one outlier study reduced the difference to 5%.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Results for the subgroup of studies comparing CBT with usual care were similar to those in the whole group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Five studies (624 analysed participants) assessed symptom severity comparing some psychological therapy with enhanced care, and found no clear evidence of a difference at end of treatment (pooled SMD -0.19; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; considerable heterogeneity; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Five studies (679 participants) showed that psychological therapies were somewhat less acceptable in terms of drop-outs than enhanced care (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	When all psychological therapies included this review were combined they were superior to usual care or waiting list in terms of reduction of symptom severity, but effect sizes were small.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	As a single treatment, only CBT has been adequately studied to allow tentative conclusions for practice to be drawn.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Compared with usual care or waiting list conditions, CBT reduced somatic symptoms, with a small effect and substantial differences in effects between CBT studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	The effects were durable within and after one year of follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Compared with enhanced or structured care, psychological therapies generally were not more effective for most of the outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Compared with enhanced care, CBT was not more effective.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	The overall quality of evidence contributing to this review was rated low to moderate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	The intervention groups reported no major harms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	However, as most studies did not describe adverse events as an explicit outcome measure, this result has to be interpreted with caution.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	An important issue was that all studies in this review included participants who were willing to receive psychological treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	In daily practice, there is also a substantial proportion of participants not willing to accept psychological treatments for somatoform disorders or MUPS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	It is unclear how large this group is and how this influences the relevance of CBT in clinical practice.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	The number of studies investigating various treatment modalities (other than CBT) needs to be increased; this is especially relevant for studies concerning physical therapies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011142.pub2	Future studies should include participants from a variety of age groups; they should also make efforts to blind outcome assessors and to conduct follow-up assessments until at least one year after the end of treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	In this updated review, we identified 40 new RCTs and seven ongoing studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	In total, we included 63 RCTs in the review, but we were only able to synthesize data on regional anaesthesia for the prevention of PPP beyond three months after surgery from 39 studies, enrolling a total of 3027 participants in our inclusive analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	Evidence synthesis of seven RCTs favoured epidural anaesthesia for thoracotomy, suggesting the odds of having PPP three to 18 months following an epidural for thoracotomy were 0.52 compared to not having an epidural (OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.84, 499 participants, moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	Simlarly, evidence synthesis of 18 RCTs favoured regional anaesthesia for the prevention of persistent pain three to 12 months after breast cancer surgery with an OR of 0.43 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.68, 1297 participants, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	Pooling data at three to 8 months after surgery from four RCTs favoured regional anaesthesia after caesarean section with an OR of 0.46, (95% CI 0.28 to 0.78; 551 participants, moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	Evidence synthesis of three RCTs investigating continuous infusion with local anaesthetic for the prevention of PPP three to 55 months after iliac crest bone graft harvesting (ICBG) was inconclusive (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.09; 123 participants, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	However, evidence synthesis of two RCTs also favoured the infusion of intravenous local anaesthetics for the prevention of PPP three to six months after breast cancer surgery with an OR of 0.24 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.69, 97 participants, moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	We did not synthesize evidence for the surgical subgroups of limb amputation, hernia repair, cardiac surgery and laparotomy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	We could not pool evidence for adverse effects because the included studies did not examine them systematically, and reported them sparsely.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	Clinical heterogeneity, attrition and sparse outcome data hampered evidence synthesis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	High risk of bias from missing data and lack of blinding across a number of included studies reduced our confidence in the findings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	Thus results must be interpreted with caution.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	We conclude that there is moderate-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing PPP after three to 18 months after thoracotomy and three to 12 months after caesarean section.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	There is low-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing PPP three to 12 months after breast cancer surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	There is moderate evidence that intravenous infusion of local anaesthetics may reduce the risk of developing PPP three to six months after breast cancer surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	Our conclusions are considerably weakened by the small size and number of studies, by performance bias, null bias, attrition and missing data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	Larger, high-quality studies, including children, are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	We caution that except for breast surgery, our evidence synthesis is based on only a few small studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	On a cautionary note, we cannot extend our conclusions to other surgical interventions or regional anaesthesia techniques, for example we cannot conclude that paravertebral block reduces the risk of PPP after thoracotomy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4	There are seven ongoing studies and 12 studies awaiting classification that may change the conclusions of the current review once they are published and incorporated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	Twenty-eight trials involving a total of 1742 trial participants were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	First-generation antipsychotics (flupenthixol decanoate, haloperidol, thiothixene); second-generation antipsychotics (aripirazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone), mood stabilisers (carbamazepine, valproate semisodium, lamotrigine, topiramate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, phenelzine sulfate, mianserin), and dietary supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) were tested.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	First-generation antipsychotics were subject to older trials, whereas recent studies focussed on second-generation antipsychotics and mood stabilisers.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	Data were sparse for individual comparisons, indicating marginal effects for first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	The findings were suggestive in supporting the use of second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and omega-3 fatty acids, but require replication, since most effect estimates were based on single studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	The long-term use of these drugs has not been assessed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	Adverse event data were scarce, except for olanzapine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	There was a possible increase in self-harming behaviour, significant weight gain, sedation and changes in haemogram parameters with olanzapine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	A significant decrease in body weight was observed with topiramate treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	All drugs were well tolerated in terms of attrition.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	Direct drug comparisons comprised two first-generation antipsychotics (loxapine versus chlorpromazine), first-generation antipsychotic against antidepressant (haloperidol versus amitriptyline; haloperidol versus phenelzine sulfate), and second-generation antipsychotic against antidepressant (olanzapine versus fluoxetine).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	Data indicated better outcomes for phenelzine sulfate but no significant differences in the other comparisons, except olanzapine which showed more weight gain and sedation than fluoxetine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	The only trial testing single versus combined drug treatment (olanzapine versus olanzapine plus fluoxetine; fluoxetine versus fluoxetine plus olanzapine) yielded no significant differences in outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	The available evidence indicates some beneficial effects with second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and dietary supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	However, these are mostly based on single study effect estimates.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	Antidepressants are not widely supported for BPD treatment, but may be helpful in the presence of comorbid conditions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	Total BPD severity was not significantly influenced by any drug.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	No promising results are available for the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2	Conclusions have to be drawn carefully in the light of several limitations of the RCT evidence that constrain applicability to everyday clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	We included seven trials involving a total of 349 participants, 217 of whom completed the studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Three were cross-over and four were parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Of these, two trials were added for this update (one parallel-group RCT with 40 participants and one cross-over RCT with 67 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Analyses of three cross-over trials yielded suboptimal results because they were based on between-group differences rather than individual participants' differences for sequential interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Two parallel-group trials had limited clinical value: one combined results for suprapubic and urethral catheters and the other provided data for only four participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Only one trial was free of significant methodological limitations, but there were difficulties with recruitment and maintaining participants in this study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	The included studies reported data on six of the nine primary and secondary outcome measures.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	None of the trials addressed: number of catheters used, washout acceptability measures (including patient satisfaction, patient discomfort, pain and ease of use), or health status/measures of psychological health; very limited data were collected for health economic outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Trials assessed only three of the eight intervention comparisons identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Two trials reported in more than one comparison group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Four trials compared washout (either saline or acidic solution) with no washout.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	We are uncertain if washout solutions (saline or acidic), compared to no washout solutions, has an important effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each catheter was in situ because the results are imprecise.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Four trials compared different types of washout solution; saline versus acidic solutions (2 trials); saline versus acidic solution versus antibiotic solution (1 trial); saline versus antimicrobial solution (1 trial).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	We are uncertain if type of washout solution has an important effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each catheter was in situ because the results are imprecise.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	One trial compared different compositions of acidic solution (stronger versus weaker solution).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	We are uncertain if different compositions of acidic solutions has an important effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each catheter was in situ because only 14 participants (of 25 who were recruited) completed this 12 week, three arm trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Four studies reported on possible harmful effects of washout use, such as blood in the washout solution, changes in blood pressure and bladder spasms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	There were very few small trials that met the review inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	The high risk of bias of the included studies resulted in the evidence being graded as low or very low quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Data from seven trials that compared different washout policies were limited, and generally, of poor methodological quality or were poorly reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	The evidence was not adequate to conclude if washouts were beneficial or harmful.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Further rigorous, high quality trials that are adequately powered to detect benefits from washout being performed as opposed to no washout are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004012.pub5	Trials comparing different washout solutions, washout volumes, and frequencies or timings are also needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	We included 30 studies (18,682 participants in total).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	Eighteen studies contributed to the main objective and 22 studies contributed to the secondary objectives.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	We found substantial differences between studies in cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, age of participants, questionnaires used to assess fatigue, and sample size.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	All included studies scored at least one 'Risk of bias' item as unclear or high risk.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	We identified both clinical and statistical heterogeneity and therefore could not pool results, so we present them descriptively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	Eighteen studies (describing 14,573 survivors) reported the prevalence of severe fatigue, which ranged from 0% to 61.7%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	In a subgroup of three studies including children aged up to 18 years at fatigue assessment (268 survivors), prevalence rates ranged from 6.7% to 12.5%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	In comparison, in a subgroup of 12 studies including participants aged 16 and over (13,952 survivors), prevalence rates ranged from 4.4% to 61.7%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	The prevalence of severe fatigue in a subgroup of survivors of haematological cancer was presented in seven studies and ranged from 1.8% to 35.9% (1907 survivors).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	Prevalence of severe fatigue in brain cancer survivors was presented in two studies (252 survivors) and was 14.6% and 21.1% respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	One study presented a prevalence for bone cancer survivors of 0.0% (17 survivors).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	Four studies provided prevalence rates of severe fatigue in control groups of siblings or population-based controls, which ranged from 3.1% to 10.3%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	In these four studies, survivors were more often fatigued than controls, but this difference was statistically significant in only two studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	Studies assessing risk and associated factors for fatigue were heterogeneous, and definitions of the factors under study were often inconsistent, with results therefore presented descriptively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	They found that depression might be associated with fatigue.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	In contrast, age at diagnosis and education level did not seem to be associated with fatigue.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	We were unable to calculate any overall risk estimate for any of the reported risks and associated factors, because we could not conduct meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	One study provided information about the course of fatigue over time, and found that over the course of 2.7 years, 32 of the 102 participants (31.4%) reported persistent severe fatigue.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	It is unclear how many childhood cancer survivors suffer from severe fatigue.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	This review encountered several difficulties.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	We found statistical and clinical heterogeneity and great variation in the reporting of possible risk and associated factors.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	The evidence in this review is therefore weak, and the exact prevalence of severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer remains to be determined.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	This is also the case for the course of severe fatigue following treatment and the strength of the relationship between fatigue and associated and risk factors.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012681.pub2	Despite these limitations, our review does provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature about severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000022.pub3	We included 36 trials involving 6914 people.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000022.pub3	There was variation in the antibiotics used, patient characteristics and risk of RTIs and mortality in the control groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000022.pub3	In trials comparing a combination of topical and systemic antibiotics, there was a significant reduction in both RTIs (number of studies = 16, odds ratio (OR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.38) and total mortality (number of studies = 17, OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87) in the treated group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000022.pub3	In trials comparing topical antimicrobials alone (or comparing topical plus systemic versus systemic alone) there was a significant reduction in RTIs (number of studies = 17, OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.63) but not in total mortality (number of studies = 19, OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16) in the treated group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000022.pub3	A combination of topical and systemic prophylactic antibiotics reduces RTIs and overall mortality in adult patients receiving intensive care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000022.pub3	Treatment based on the use of topical prophylaxis alone reduces respiratory infections but not mortality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000022.pub3	The risk of resistance occurring as a negative consequence of antibiotic use was appropriately explored only in one trial which did not show any such effect.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	Five cluster-randomised controlled studies met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	All of them investigated educational approaches.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	Two studies offered consultation in addition and two other studies offered guidance for nursing staff in addition.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	Four studies examined nursing home residents and one study residents in group dwelling units.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	No studies in community settings were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	Three studies included only one or two nursing homes per study condition.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	Overall, methodological quality of studies was low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	The studies revealed inconsistent results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	One study in the nursing home setting documented an increase of PR use in both groups after eight months, while the other three studies found reduced use of PR in the intervention groups after seven and 12 months of follow up respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	The single study examining residents in group dwelling units found no change in PR use in the intervention group after six months whereas PR use increased significantly in the control group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2	There is insufficient evidence supporting the effectiveness of educational interventions targeting nursing staff for preventing or reducing the use of physical restraints in geriatric long-term care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	Four RCTs were included in the review (416 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	The trials compared glucocorticoid supplementation during IVF stimulation versus placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	Two of the studies had data in a form that we could not enter into analysis, so results include data from only two trials (310) women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	For the outcome of live birth, data were available for only 212 women, as the larger study had data available from only one study centre.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	One of the studies gave inadequate description of randomisation methods, but the other was at low risk of bias in all domains.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	The evidence was rated as low or very low quality for all outcomes, mainly due to imprecision, with low sample sizes and few events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference between the groups in live birth rate (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.58; 2 RCTs, n = 212, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	Our findings suggest that if the chance of live birth with placebo is assumed to be 15%, the chance following supplementation would be between 7% and 31%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in the clinical pregnancy rate (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.90; 2 RCTs, n = 310, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	The evidence suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy with placebo is assumed to be 24%, the chance following treatment with glucocorticoid supplementation would be between 23% and 47%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference between the groups in multiple-pregnancy rate (OR 3.32 , 95% CI 0.12 to 91.60; 1 RCT , n = 20, very low-quality evidence) or miscarriage rate (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.05 to 18.57; 1 RCT, n = 20, very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	Neither of the studies reported OHSS or side-effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	The safety and effectiveness of glucocorticoid administration in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF/ICSI cycles (until the day of oocyte retrieval) is unclear due to the small number of studies and low event rates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	Whilst glucocorticoids possibly increase the clinical pregnancy rate, there may be little or no impact on live birth rate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004752.pub2	More research is needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	We included eight trials (291 participants, aged between five and 23 years) in this revision of the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	Seven trials compared standard-dose rhGH (approximately 0.3 mg/kg/week) to no treatment and one three-arm trial (63 participants) compared placebo, standard-dose rhGH (0.3 mg/kg/week) and high-dose rhGH (0.5 mg/kg/week).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	We found that rhGH treatment may improve some of the pulmonary function outcomes but there was no difference between standard and high-dose levels (low-quality evidence, limited by inconsistency across the trials, small number of participants and short duration of therapy).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	The trials show evidence of improvement in the anthropometric parameters (height, weight and lean body mass) with rhGH therapy, again no differences between dose levels.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	We found improvement in height for all comparisons (very low- to low quality evidence), but improvements in weight and lean body mass were only reported for standard-dose rhGH versus no treatment (very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	There is some evidence indicating a change in the level of fasting blood glucose with rhGH therapy, however, it did not cross the clinical threshold for diagnosis of diabetes in the trials of short duration (low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	There is low- to very low-quality evidence for improvement of pulmonary exacerbations with no further significant adverse effects, but this is limited by the short duration of trials and the small number of participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	One small trial provided inconsistent evidence on improvement in quality of life (very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	There is limited evidence from three trials in improvements in exercise capacity (low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	None of the trials have systematically compared the expense of therapy on overall healthcare costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	When compared with no treatment, rhGH therapy is effective in improving the intermediate outcomes in height, weight and lean body mass.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	Some measures of pulmonary function showed moderate improvement, but no consistent benefit was seen across all trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	The significant change in blood glucose levels, although not causing diabetes, emphasizes the need for careful monitoring of this adverse effect with therapy in a population predisposed to CF-related diabetes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	No significant changes in quality of life, clinical status or side-effects were observed in this review due to the small number of participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub4	Long-term, well-designed randomised controlled trials of rhGH in individuals with CF are required prior to routine clinical use of rhGH in CF.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	We included 26 non-randomized controlled before and after studies with 1,695 participants that reported on three comparisons: complete removal from exposure and reduced exposure compared to continued exposure, and complete removal from exposure compared to reduced exposure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Reduction of exposure was achieved by limiting use of the agent, improving ventilation, or using protective equipment in the same job; by changing to another job with intermittent exposure; or by implementing education programs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	For continued exposure, 56 per 1000 workers reported absence of symptoms at follow-up, the decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of a reference value (FEV1 %) was 5.4% during follow-up, and the standardized change in non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity (NSBH) was -0.18.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	In 18 studies, authors compared removal from exposure to continued exposure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Removal may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of asthma symptoms, with risk ratio (RR) 4.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 13.86), and it may improve asthma symptoms, with RR 2.47 (95% CI 1.26 to 4.84), compared to continued exposure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Change in FEV1 % may be better with removal from exposure, with a mean difference (MD) of 4.23 % (95% CI 1.14 to 7.31) compared to continued exposure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	NSBH may improve with removal from exposure, with standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.43 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.82).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	In seven studies, authors compared reduction of exposure to continued exposure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Reduction of exposure may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms, with RR 2.65 (95% CI 1.24 to 5.68).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	There may be no considerable difference in FEV1 % between reduction and continued exposure, with MD 2.76 % (95% CI -1.53 to 7.04) .	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	No studies reported or enabled calculation of change in NSBH.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	In ten studies, authors compared removal from exposure to reduction of exposure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Following removal from exposure there may be no increase in the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms, with RR 6.05 (95% CI 0.86 to 42.34), and improvement in symptoms, with RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.47), as well as no considerable change in FEV1 %, with MD 2.58 % (95% CI −3.02 to 8.17).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	However, with all three outcomes, there may be improved results for removal from exposure in the subset of patients exposed to low molecular weight agents.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	No studies reported or enabled calculation of change in NSBH.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	In two studies, authors reported that the risk of unemployment after removal from exposure may increase compared with reduction of exposure, with RR 14.28 (95% CI 2.06 to 99.16).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Four studies reported a decrease in income of 20% to 50% after removal from exposure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	The quality of the evidence is very low for all outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Both removal from exposure and reduction of exposure may improve asthma symptoms compared with continued exposure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Removal from exposure, but not reduction of exposure, may improve lung function compared to continued exposure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	When we compared removal from exposure directly to reduction of exposure, the former may improve symptoms and lung function more among patients exposed to low molecular weight agents.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Removal from exposure may also increase the risk of unemployment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Care providers should balance the potential clinical benefits of removal from exposure or reduction of exposure with potential detrimental effects of unemployment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4	Additional high-quality studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace interventions for occupational asthma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	The review included six trials (n = 1758).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	Trial participants were aged 48 to 57 years, except for one trial that had a mean age of 73 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	All participants were from the outpatient setting and had either nonerosive reflux disease or milder grades of esophagitis (LA grade A or B).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	Five trials investigated on-demand deprescribing and one trial examined abrupt discontinuation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	There was low quality evidence that on-demand use of PPI may increase risk of 'lack of symptom control' compared with continuous PPI use (risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 2.21), thereby favoring continuous PPI use (five trials, n = 1653).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	There was a clinically significant reduction in 'drug burden', measured as PPI pill use per week with on-demand therapy (mean difference (MD) -3.79, 95% CI -4.73 to -2.84), favoring deprescribing based on moderate quality evidence (four trials, n = 1152).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	There was also low quality evidence that on-demand PPI use may be associated with reduced participant satisfaction compared with continuous PPI use.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	None of the included studies reported cost/resource use or positive drug withdrawal effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	In people with mild GERD, on-demand deprescribing may lead to an increase in GI symptoms (e.g. dyspepsia, regurgitation) and probably a reduction in pill burden.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	There was a decline in participant satisfaction, although heterogeneity was high.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011969.pub2	There were insufficient data to make a conclusion regarding long-term benefits and harms of PPI discontinuation, although two trials (one on-demand trial and one abrupt discontinuation trial) reported endoscopic findings in their intervention groups at study end.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	We included 13 randomised trials (975 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	These evaluated social skills programmes versus standard care, or discussion group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	We found evidence in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	We also found that rates of relapse and rehospitalisation were lower for social skills compared to standard care (relapse: 2 RCTs, n = 263, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.79, very low quality evidence), (rehospitalisation: 1 RCT, n = 143, RR 0.53 CI 0.30 to 0.93, very low quality evidence) and participants’ mental state results (1 RCT, n = 91, MD -4.01 CI -7.52 to -0.50, very low quality evidence) were better in the group receiving social skill programmes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	Global state was measured in one trial by numbers not experiencing a clinical improvement, results favoured social skills (1 RCT, n = 67, RR 0.29 CI 0.12 to 0.68, very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care (1 RCT, n = 112, MD -7.60 CI -12.18 to -3.02, very low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	However, when social skills programmes were compared to a discussion group control, we found no significant differences in the participants social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality of life, again the quality of evidence for these outcomes was very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	Compared to standard care, social skills training may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates, but at present, the evidence is very limited with data rated as very low quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	When social skills training was compared to discussion there was no difference on patients outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	Cultural differences might limit the applicability of the current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009006.pub2	Whether social skills training can improve social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be investigated in a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	Only one study, at low risk of all biases, met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	This was the pooled results from two RCTs (225 participants, 145 with tophi at baseline) randomised to one of three arms; pegloticase infusion every two weeks (biweekly), monthly pegloticase infusion (pegloticase infusion alternating with placebo infusion every two weeks) and placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	Moderate-quality evidence from one study indicated that biweekly pegloticase 8 mg infusion reduced tophi in the subset of participants with tophi, but increased withdrawals due to adverse events in all participants, and monthly infusion appeared to result in less benefit.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	Biweekly pegloticase treatment resulted in resolution of tophi in 21/52 participants compared with 2/27 who received placebo (risk ratio (RR) 5.45, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.38 to 21.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3 (95% CI 2 to 6).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	Eleven of 52 participants with monthly pegloticase treatment had complete resolution of one or more tophi compared with 2/27 who received placebo (RR 2.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 11.97).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	Participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater, function, quality of life, serum urate normalisation, were reported for all participants but not separately for those with tophi; therefore, we did not include the results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	Pegloticase administered biweekly resulted in more withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo (15/85 participants with pegloticase versus 1/43 participants with placebo; RR 7.59, 95% CI 1.04 to 55.55; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 7, 95% CI 4 to 17).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	Pegloticase administered monthly also resulted in more withdrawals due to adverse events than placebo (16/84 participants with pegloticase versus 1/43 participants with placebo; RR 8.19, 95% CI 1.12 to 59.71; NNTH 6, 95% CI 4 to 14).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	Most withdrawals were due to infusion reactions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	Total adverse events were high in all treatment groups: 80/85 participants administered pegloticase biweekly reported an adverse event compared with 41/43 from the placebo group (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07); 84/84 participants administered pegloticase monthly reported an adverse event versus 41/43 in the placebo group (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.14).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	As 80% of adverse events were due to flares of gout, probably unrelated to the drug treatment per se, this may explain the high rate of adverse events in the placebo group - who were essentially untreated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	This study showed pegloticase is probably beneficial in the management of tophi in gout, in terms of resolution of tophi, but with a high risk of adverse infusion reactions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2	However, there is a need for more RCT data considering other interventions, including surgical removal of tophi.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001816.pub3	The search identified five studies on oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC of which three met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001816.pub3	In this review of the three eligible trials (including 2095 neonates), the oral administration of IgG or an IgG/IgA combination did not result in a significant reduction in the incidence of definite NEC (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.25; typical risk difference (RD) -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01; 3 studies, 1840 infants), suspected NEC (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01; 1 study, 1529 infants), need for surgery (typical RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.75; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00; 2 studies, 311 infants) or death from NEC (typical RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.59; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; 3 studies, 1840 infants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001816.pub3	Based on the available trials, the evidence does not support the administration of oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001816.pub3	There are no randomized controlled trials of oral IgA alone for the prevention of NEC.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	Five RCTs compared no additional treatment with additional chemotherapy after hysterectomy and radiotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	Four trials compared platinum based combination chemotherapy directly with radiotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	Indiscriminate pooling of survival data from 2197 women shows a significant overall survival advantage from adjuvant chemotherapy (RR (95% CI) = 0.88 (0.79 to 0.99)).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	Sensitivity analysis focused on trials of modern platinum based chemotherapy regimens and found the relative risk of death to be 0.85 ((0.76 to 0.96); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) = 25; absolute risk reduction = 4% (1% to 8%)).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	The HR for overall survival is 0.74 (0.64 to 0.89), significantly favouring the addition of postoperative platinum based chemotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	The HR for progression-free survival is 0.75 (0.64 to 0.89).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	This means that chemotherapy reduces the risk of being dead at any censorship by a quarter.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	Chemotherapy reduces the risk of developing the first recurrence outside the pelvis (RR = 0.79 (0.68 to 0.92), 5% absolute risk reduction; NNT = 20).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	The analysis of pelvic recurrence rates is underpowered but the trend suggests that chemotherapy may be less effective than radiotherapy in a direct comparison (RR = 1.28 (0.97 to 1.68)) but it may have added value when used with radiotherapy (RR = 0.48 (0.20 to 1.18)).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	Postoperative platinum based chemotherapy is associated with a small benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival irrespective of radiotherapy treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003175.pub2	It reduces the risk of developing a metastasis, could be an alternative to radiotherapy and has added value when used with radiotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Nineteen studies were conducted in low- and middle-income settings and sixteen in high-income settings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people felt they would like from a digital health intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	The studies covered a range of digital targeted client communication, for example medication or appointment reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or general sexual health information.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Our synthesis showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	They also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Language issues as well as skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were also concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Some clients suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme (moderate confidence).	1

10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Our matrix shows that many of the trials assessing these types of programmes did not try to address the problems we identified, although this may have been a reporting issue.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Our synthesis identified several factors that can influence the successful implementation of targeted client communication programmes using mobile devices.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	These include barriers to use that have equity implications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Programme planners should take these factors into account when designing and implementing programmes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD013447	Future trial authors also need to actively address these factors and to report their efforts in their trial publications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003409.pub4	Twenty-three trials involving 2467 people were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003409.pub4	Comparing methadone versus any other pharmacological treatment, we observed no clinical difference between the two treatments in terms of completion of treatment, 16 studies 1381 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.21); number of participants abstinent at follow-up, three studies, 386 participants RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.37); degree of discomfort for withdrawal symptoms and adverse events, although it was impossible to pool data for the last two outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003409.pub4	These results were confirmed also when we considered the single comparisons: methadone with: adrenergic agonists (11 studies), other opioid agonists (eight studies), anxiolytic (two studies), paiduyangsheng (one study).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003409.pub4	Comparing methadone with placebo (two studies) more severe withdrawal and more drop-outs were found in the placebo group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003409.pub4	The results indicate that the medications used in the included studies are similar in terms of overall effectiveness, although symptoms experienced by participants differed according to the medication used and the program adopted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003409.pub4	Data from literature are hardly comparable; programs vary widely with regard to the assessment of outcome measures, impairing the application of meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003409.pub4	The studies included in this review confirm that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long- acting opioids, can reduce withdrawal severity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003409.pub4	Nevertheless, the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002022.pub3	Nine studies (eight randomised controlled trials) involving 1109 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002022.pub3	Antagonist-induced withdrawal is more intense but less prolonged than withdrawal managed with reducing doses of methadone, and doses of naltrexone sufficient for blockade of opioid effects can be established significantly more quickly with antagonist-induced withdrawal than withdrawal managed with clonidine and symptomatic medications.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002022.pub3	The level of sedation does not affect the intensity and duration of withdrawal, although the duration of anaesthesia may influence withdrawal severity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002022.pub3	There is a significantly greater risk of adverse events with heavy, compared to light, sedation (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 9.12, P = 0.03) and probably with this approach compared to other forms of detoxification.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002022.pub3	Heavy sedation compared to light sedation does not confer additional benefits in terms of less severe withdrawal or increased rates of commencement on naltrexone maintenance treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002022.pub3	Given that the adverse events are potentially life-threatening, the value of antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia is not supported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002022.pub3	The high cost of anaesthesia-based approaches, both in monetary terms and use of scarce intensive care resources, suggest that this form of treatment should not be pursued.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002083.pub2	We included fourteen studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002083.pub2	Duration ranged from very short (10 days) studies of the intramuscular preparation, to trials lasting over three months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002083.pub2	For measures of global assessment, available data do not justify any conclusions on the comparative efficacy of molindone and placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002083.pub2	When compared to other typical antipsychotics we found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness (doctors' 4 RCTs n=150, RR 1.13, CI 0.69 to 1.86; nurses 4RCTs n=146, RR 1.23, CI 0.82 to 1.86).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002083.pub2	Molindone is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but it does cause significantly more weight loss (2RCTs n=60 RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99, NNH 5 CI 2 to 77).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002083.pub2	The strength of the evidence relating to this compound is limited, owing to small sample size, poor study design, limited outcomes and incomplete reporting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002083.pub2	Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic but its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics (apart from the event of weight loss).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002083.pub2	Data from this review suggest, at present, there is no evidence to suggest that it may have an atypical profile.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	We included 20 studies with a total of 2125 participants covering 23 different treatments.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	Statistical pooling of the data was not possible due to the heterogeneity of treatments.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	Each study involved a different set of interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	They can be grouped into those including a bleaching agent such as hydroquinone, triple-combination creams (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide), and combination therapies (hydroquinone cream and glycolic acid peels), as well as less conventional therapies including rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes like Thiospot and Gigawhite.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	Triple-combination cream was significantly more effective at lightening melasma than hydroquinone alone (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97) or when compared to the dual combinations of tretinoin and hydroquinone (RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.74), tretinoin and fluocinolone acetonide (RR 14.00, 95% CI 4.43 to 44.25), or hydroquinone and fluocinolone acetonide (RR 10.50, 95% CI 3.85 to 28.60).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	Azelaic acid (20%) was significantly more effective than 2% hydroquinone (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48) at lightening melasma but not when compared to 4% hydroquinone (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	In two studies where tretinoin was compared to placebo, participants rated their melasma as significantly improved in one (RR 13, 95% CI 1.88 to 89.74) but not the other.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	In both studies by other objective measures tretinoin treatment significantly reduced the severity of melasma.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	Thiospot was more effective than placebo (SMD -2.61, 95% CI -3.76 to -1.47).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	The adverse events most commonly reported were mild and transient such as skin irritation, itching, burning, and stinging.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	The quality of studies evaluating melasma treatments was generally poor and available treatments inadequate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2	High-quality randomised controlled trials on well-defined participants with long-term outcomes to determine the duration of response are needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	Twelve trials, which randomised 1319 participants, were included in the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	As far as can be determined from the trial reports, the methodological quality of the trials was not high, including a high risk of detection bias in many.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	Of note, only one study reported low-dose postoperative 5-FU and this paper was at high risk of reporting bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	Not all studies reported population characteristics, of those that did mean age ranged from 61 to 75 years.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	83% of participants were white and 40% were male.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	All studies were a minimum of one year long.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	A significant reduction in surgical failure in the first year after trabeculectomy was detected in eyes at high risk of failure and those undergoing surgery for the first time receiving regular-dose 5-FU postoperative injections (RR 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.68 and 0.21, 0.06 to 0.68, respectively).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	No surgical failures were detected in studies assessing combined surgery.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	No difference was detected in the low-dose postoperative 5-FU injection group in patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.24).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	Peroperative 5-FU in patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy significantly reduced risk of failure (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	This translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4.1 for the high risk of failure patients, and 5.0 for primary trabeculectomy patients receiving postoperative 5-FU.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	Intraocular pressure was also reduced in the primary trabeculectomy group receiving intraoperative 5-FU (mean difference (MD) -1.04, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.43) and regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -4.67, 95% CI -6.60 to -2.73).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	No significant change occurred in the primary trabeculectomy group receiving low-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -0.50, 95% CI -2.96 to 1.96).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	Intraocular pressure was particularly reduced in the high risk of failure population receiving regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -16.30, 95% CI -18.63 to -13.97).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	No difference was detected in the combined surgery population receiving regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -1.02, 95% CI -2.40 to 0.37).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	Whilst no evidence was found of an increased risk of serious sight-threatening complications, other complications are more common after 5-FU injections.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	None of the trials reported on the participants' perspective of care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	The quality of evidence varied between subgroups and outcomes, most notably the evidence for combined surgery and low-dose postoperative 5-FU was found to be very low using GRADE.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	The combined surgery postoperative 5-FU subgroup because no surgical failures have been reported and the sample size is small (n = 118), and the low-dose postoperative 5-FU group because of the small sample size (n = 76) and high risk of bias of the only contributing study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	Postoperative injections of 5-FU are now rarely used as part of routine packages of postoperative care but are increasingly used on an ad hoc basis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	This presumably reflects an aspect of the treatment that is unacceptable to both patients and doctors.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	None of the trials reported on the participants' perspective of care, which constitutes a serious omission for an invasive treatment such as this.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001132.pub2	The small but statistically significant reduction in surgical failures and intraocular pressure at one year in the primary trabeculectomy group and high-risk group must be weighed against the increased risk of complications and patient preference.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002991.pub3	Fifty-five primary studies with 16,154 participants met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002991.pub3	Long-term use of ICS (more than six months) did not consistently reduce the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in COPD patients (generic inverse variance analysis: mean difference (MD) 5.80 mL/year with ICS over placebo, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 11.88, 2333 participants; pooled means analysis: 6.88 mL/year, 95% CI 1.80 to 11.96, 4823 participants), although one major trial demonstrated a statistically significant difference.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002991.pub3	There was no statistically significant effect on mortality in COPD patients (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 8390 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002991.pub3	Long-term use of ICS reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (generic inverse variance analysis: MD -0.26 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14, 2586 participants; pooled means analysis: MD -0.19 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.08, 2253 participants).	0

10.1002/14651858.CD002991.pub3	Response to ICS was not predicted by oral steroid response, bronchodilator reversibility or bronchial hyper-responsiveness in COPD patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002991.pub3	There was an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.65, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.46, 5586 participants) and hoarseness.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002991.pub3	In the long-term studies, the rate of pneumonia was increased in the ICS group compared to placebo, in studies that reported pneumonia as an adverse event (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86, 6235 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002991.pub3	The long-term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures and bone mineral density over three years.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002991.pub3	Patients and clinicians should balance the potential benefits of inhaled steroids in COPD (reduced rate of exacerbations, reduced rate of decline in quality of life and possibly reduced rate of decline in FEV1) against the potential side effects (oropharyngeal candidiasis and hoarseness, and risk of pneumonia).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	We included 80 randomised controlled trials (5820 women).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	They compared 20 different NSAIDs (18 non-selective and two COX-2-specific) versus placebo, paracetamol or each other.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	NSAIDs versus placebo	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	Among women with primary dysmenorrhoea, NSAIDs were more effective for pain relief than placebo (OR 4.37, 95% CI 3.76 to 5.09; 35 RCTs, I2 = 53%, low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	This suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	However, NSAIDs were associated with more adverse effects (overall adverse effects: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.51, 25 RCTs, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence; gastrointestinal adverse effects: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.23, 14 RCTs, I2 = 30%; neurological adverse effects: OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.66 to 4.53, seven RCTs, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	The evidence suggests that if 10% of women taking placebo experience side effects, between 11% and 14% of women taking NSAIDs will do so.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	When NSAIDs were compared with each other there was little evidence of the superiority of any individual NSAID for either pain relief or safety.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	However, the available evidence had little power to detect such differences, as most individual comparisons were based on very few small trials.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	Only two of the included studies utilised COX-2-specific inhibitors (etoricoxib and celecoxib).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	There was no evidence that COX-2-specific inhibitors were more effective or tolerable for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea than traditional NSAIDs; however data were very scanty.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	NSAIDs versus paracetamol NSAIDs appeared to be more effective for pain relief than paracetamol (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.43, three RCTs, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	There was no evidence of a difference with regard to adverse effects, though data were very scanty.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	Most of the studies were commercially funded (59%); a further 31% failed to state their source of funding.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	NSAIDs appear to be a very effective treatment for dysmenorrhoea, though women using them need to be aware of the substantial risk of adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	There is insufficient evidence to determine which (if any) individual NSAID is the safest and most effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3	We rated the quality of the evidence as low for most comparisons, mainly due to poor reporting of study methods.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	We included seven studies that compared high versus low levels of PEEP (2565 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	In five of the studies (2417 participants), a comparison was made between high and low levels of PEEP with the same tidal volume in both groups, but in the remaining two studies (148 participants), the tidal volume was different between high- and low-level groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	We saw evidence of risk of bias in three studies, and the remaining studies fulfilled all criteria for adequate trial quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	In the main analysis, we assessed mortality occurring before hospital discharge only in those studies that compared high versus low PEEP with the same tidal volume in both groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	With the three studies that were included, the meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.01), nor was any statistically significant difference seen in the risk of barotrauma (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	Oxygenation was improved in the high-PEEP group, although data derived from the studies showed a considerable degree of statistical heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	The number of ventilator-free days showed no significant difference between the two groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	Available data were insufficient to allow pooling of length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	The subgroup of participants with ARDS showed decreased mortality in the ICU, although it must be noted that in two of the three included studies, the authors used a protective ventilatory strategy involving a low tidal volume and high levels of PEEP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	Available evidence indicates that high levels of PEEP, as compared with low levels, did not reduce mortality before hospital discharge.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	The data also show that high levels of PEEP produced no significant difference in the risk of barotrauma, but rather improved participants' oxygenation to the first, third, and seventh days.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009098.pub2	This review indicates that the included studies were characterized by clinical heterogeneity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	This review included 42 studies (11,399 patients) including 19 studies from the original review (2010), as well as 23 new studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	Fifteen studies were excluded from the original review (nine retracted from publication due to concerns about integrity of data and six lacking individual patient creatinine data for the calculation of RIFLE criteria).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	Overall, there was a significant increase in the need for RRT in the HES treated individuals compared to individuals treated with other fluid therapies (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.49; 19 studies, 9857 patients) and the number with author-defined kidney failure (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.00; 15 studies, 1361 patients).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	The RR of AKI based on RIFLE-F (failure) criteria also showed an increased risk of AKI in individuals treated with HES products (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.30; 15 studies, 8402 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	The risk of meeting urine output and creatinine based RIFLE-R (risk) criteria for AKI was in contrast in favour of HES therapies (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99; 20 studies, 8769 patients).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	However, when RIFLE-R urine output based outcomes were excluded as per study protocol, the direction of AKI risk again favoured the other fluid type, with a non-significant RR of AKI in HES treated patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.14; 8445 patients).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	A more robust effect was seen for the RIFLE-I (injury) outcome, with a RR of AKI of 1.22 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.37; 8338 patients).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	No differences between subgroups for the RRT and RIFLE-F based outcomes were seen between sepsis versus non-sepsis patients, high molecular weight (MW) and degree of substitution (DS) versus low MW and DS (≥ 200 kDa and > 0.4 DS versus 130 kDa and 0.4 DS) HES solutions, or high versus low dose treatments (i.e. ≥ 2 L versus < 2 L).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	There were differences identified between sepsis versus non-sepsis subgroups for the RIFLE-R and RIFLE-I based outcomes only, which may reflect the differing renal response to fluid resuscitation in pre-renal versus sepsis-associated AKI.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	Overall, methodological quality of the studies was good.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	The current evidence suggests that all HES products increase the risk in AKI and RRT in all patient populations and a safe volume of any HES solution has yet to be determined.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007594.pub3	In most clinical situations it is likely that these risks outweigh any benefits, and alternate volume replacement therapies should be used in place of HES products.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008000.pub2	We identified nine studies that enrolled 682 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008000.pub2	None of the studies reported blinding or group allocation methods.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008000.pub2	Seven studies were judged to be at low risk of incomplete outcome reporting; three studies were judged to be a low risk of selective reporting (protocols were available and/or all outcomes relevant to the this review were reported); and two studies were judged free of other potential biases.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008000.pub2	Seven studies compared Rheum officinale with no treatment and two made comparisons with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008000.pub2	Compared with no treatment, Rheum officinale had a positive effect on SCr (MD -87.49 µmol/L, 95% CI -139.25 to -35.72) and BUN (MD -10.61 mmol/L, 95% CI -19.45 to -2.21).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008000.pub2	Compared with captopril, a statistically significant difference was not demonstrated in relation to Rheum officinale for any outcome (BUN, CrCl, or patients' capacity to undertake work).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008000.pub2	No data were available on all-cause mortality or cost of treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008000.pub2	Only minor adverse events were reported in association with Rheum officinale.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008000.pub2	Currently available evidence concerning the efficacy of Rheum officinale to improve SCr and BUN levels in patients with CKD is both scant and low quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008000.pub2	Although Rheum officinale does not appear to be associated with serious adverse events among patients with CKD, there is no current evidence to support any recommendation for its use.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010772.pub2	From 72 papers describing IQCODE test accuracy, we included 13 papers, representing data from 2745 individuals (n = 1413 (51%) with dementia).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010772.pub2	Pooled analysis of all studies using data presented closest to a cut-off of 3.3 indicated that sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94); specificity 0.66 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.75); the positive likelihood ratio was 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.6) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.22).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010772.pub2	There was a statistically significant difference in test accuracy between the general hospital setting and the specialist memory setting (P = 0.019), suggesting that IQCODE performs better in a 'general' setting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010772.pub2	We found no significant differences in the test accuracy of the short (16-item) versus the 26-item IQCODE, or in the language of administration.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010772.pub2	There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies, including a highly varied prevalence of dementia (10.5% to 87.4%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010772.pub2	Across the included papers there was substantial potential for bias, particularly around sampling of included participants and selection criteria, which may limit generalisability.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010772.pub2	There was also evidence of suboptimal reporting, particularly around disease severity and handling indeterminate results, which are important if considering use in clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010772.pub2	The IQCODE can be used to identify older adults in the general hospital setting who are at risk of dementia and require specialist assessment; it is useful specifically for ruling out those without evidence of cognitive decline.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010772.pub2	The language of administration did not affect test accuracy, which supports the cross-cultural use of the tool.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010772.pub2	These findings are qualified by the significant heterogeneity, the potential for bias and suboptimal reporting found in the included studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009689.pub2	We included three RCTs involving 91 participants.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD009689.pub2	There was 'low quality' evidence for mCIMT improving upper limb motor function and spasticity in chronic stroke survivors with residual voluntary upper limb activity, up to six months, and 'very low quality' evidence for dynamic elbow splinting and occupational therapy reducing elbow range of movement at 14 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009689.pub2	Task practice therapy with cyclic FES did not improve upper limb function more than task practice therapy alone, only at 12 weeks.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD009689.pub2	At best there was 'low level' evidence for the effectiveness of outpatient MD rehabilitation in improving active function and impairments following BoNT for upper limb spasticity in adults with chronic stroke.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009689.pub2	No trials explored the effect of MD rehabilitation on 'passive function' (caring for the affected limb), caregiver burden, or the individual's priority goals for treatment.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD006748.pub4	The results of this review indicate that no substantive meaningful benefits are associated with social norms interventions for prevention of alcohol misuse among college/university students.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006748.pub4	Although some significant effects were found, we interpret the effect sizes as too small, given the measurement scales used in the studies included in this review, to be of relevance for policy or practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006748.pub4	Moreover, the significant effects are not consistent for all misuse measures, heterogeneity was a problem in some analyses and bias cannot be discounted as a potential cause of these findings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	We included three trials with a total of 492 participants who had received 530 THA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	The evidence presented with a high risk of performance, detection and reporting bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	One study (81 participants) compared outcomes for participants randomised to the provision of hip precautions, equipment and functional restrictions versus no provision of hip precautions, equipment or functional restrictions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	Due to the quality of evidence being very low, we are uncertain if the provision of hip precautions, equipment and functional restrictions improved function measured using the Harris Hip Score at 12 month follow-up, or health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measured by the Short Form-12 at four week follow-up, compared to not providing this.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	There were no incidences of hip dislocation or adverse events in either group during the initial 12 postoperative months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	The study did not measure pain score, global assessment of treatment success or total adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	One study (265 participants; 303 THAs) evaluated the provision of hip precautions with versus without the prescription of postoperative equipment and restrictions to functional activities.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	Due to the quality of evidence being very low, we are uncertain if perceived satisfaction in the rate of recovery differed in people who were not prescribed postoperative equipment and restrictions (135/151 satisfied) compared to those prescribed equipment and restrictions (113/152) (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.93; 265 participants, one trial; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 7).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	Due to the low quality evidence, we are uncertain if the incidence of hip dislocation differed between participants provided with hip precautions with (1/152) compared to without providing equipment or restrictions post-THA (0/151) (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.59).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	The study did not measure pain, function, HRQOL, re-operation rates or total adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	One study (146 participants) investigated the provision of an enhanced postoperative education and rehabilitation service on hospital discharge to promote functional ADL versus a conventional rehabilitation intervention in the community.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	This study was of very low quality evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	We were uncertain if the provision of enhanced postoperative education and rehabilitation improved function at six months follow-up, when assessed using the Objective and Subjective Functional Capability Index (146 participants, one trial; P > 0.05; no numerical results provided) compared to conventional rehabilitation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	The study did not measure pain score, HRQOL, global assessment of treatment success, hip dislocation, re-operation rate or total adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	Very low quality evidence is available from single trials, thus we are uncertain if hip precautions with or without the addition of equipment and functional restrictions are effective in preventing dislocation and improving outcomes after THA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	There is also insufficient evidence to support or refute the adoption of a postoperative community rehabilitation programme consisting of functional reintegration and education compared to conventional rehabilitation strategies based on functional outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	Further high-quality trials are warranted to assess the outcomes of different occupational therapy interventions both in the short and longer-term for those who undergo THA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010815.pub2	An assessment of the impact of such interventions on pain and restriction on personal ADL, EADL and instrumental ADL is needed, and also of functional integration-type interventions rather than just hip precautions, equipment and restrictions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005072.pub3	Three randomised controlled trials were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005072.pub3	In two trials, there was a statistically significant reduction in the recurrence of painful periods in the LNG-IUD group compared with expectant management (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.60, 95 women, I2 = 0%, moderate strength of evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005072.pub3	The proportion of women who were satisfied with their treatment was also higher in the LNG-IUD group but did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.82, 95 women, I2 = 0%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005072.pub3	The number of women reporting a change in menstruation was significantly higher in the LNG-IUD group (RR 37.80, 95% CI 5.40 to 264.60, 95 women, I2 = 0%) but the number of women not completing the allocated treatment did not differ between groups (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.25, I2 = 43%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005072.pub3	In one trial, women receiving LNG-IUD noted lower pain scores compared with women receiving gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (MD -0.16, 95% CI -2.02 to 1.70, 40 women) but this did not reach statistical significance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005072.pub3	There is limited but consistent evidence showing that postoperative LNG-IUD use reduces the recurrence of painful periods in women with endometriosis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005072.pub3	Further well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	We included 24 studies, with the majority (20/24) giving concerns about risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	All of the included studies investigated food products; none investigated alcohol or tobacco.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	The majority were conducted in laboratory settings (14/24), with adult participants (17/24), and used between-participants designs (19/24).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	All studies were conducted in high-income countries, predominantly in the USA (14/24).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	Six studies investigated availability interventions, of which two changed the absolute number of different options available, and four altered the relative proportion of less-healthy (to healthier) options.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	Most studies (4/6) manipulated snack foods or drinks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	For selection outcomes, meta-analysis of three comparisons from three studies (n = 154) found that exposure to fewer options resulted in a large reduction in selection of the targeted food(s): SMD −1.13 (95% confidence interval (CI) −1.90 to −0.37) (low certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	For consumption outcomes, meta-analysis of three comparisons from two studies (n = 150) found that exposure to fewer options resulted in a moderate reduction in consumption of those foods, but with considerable uncertainty: SMD −0.55 (95% CI −1.27 to 0.18) (low certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	Eighteen studies investigated proximity interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	Most (14/18) changed the distance at which a snack food or drink was placed from the participants, whilst four studies changed the order of meal components encountered along a line.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	For selection outcomes, only one study with one comparison (n = 41) was identified, which found that food placed farther away resulted in a moderate reduction in its selection: SMD −0.65 (95% CI −1.29 to −0.01) (very low certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	For consumption outcomes, meta-analysis of 15 comparisons from 12 studies (n = 1098) found that exposure to food placed farther away resulted in a moderate reduction in its consumption: SMD −0.60 (95% CI −0.84 to −0.36) (low certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	Meta-regression analyses indicated that this effect was greater: the farther away the product was placed; when only the targeted product(s) was available; when participants were of low deprivation status; and when the study was at high risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	The current evidence suggests that changing the number of available food options or altering the positioning of foods could contribute to meaningful changes in behaviour, justifying policy actions to promote such changes within food environments.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	However, the certainty of this evidence as assessed by GRADE is low or very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3	To enable more certain and generalisable conclusions about these potentially important effects, further research is warranted in real-world settings, intervening across a wider range of foods - as well as alcohol and tobacco products - and over sustained time periods.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	Only one case-control study was included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	HIV transmission was significantly associated with deep injury (OR 15, 95% CI 6.0 to 41), visible blood on the device (OR 6.2, 95% CI 2.2 to 21), procedures involving a needle placed in the source patient's blood vessel (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 12), and terminal illness in the source patient (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.0 to 16).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	After controlling for these risk factors, no differences were detected in the rates at which cases and controls were offered post-exposure prophylaxis with zidovudine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	However, cases had significantly lower odds of having taken zidovudine after exposure compared to controls (OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.52).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	No studies were found that evaluated the effect of two or more antiretroviral drugs for occupational PEP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	Adherence to and complications with PEP  Eight reports from observational comparative studies confirmed findings that adverse events were higher with a three-drug regimen, especially one containing indinavir.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	However, discontinuation rates were not significantly different.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	The use of occupational PEP is based on limited direct evidence of effect.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	However, it is highly unlikely that a definitive placebo-controlled trial will ever be conducted, and, therefore, on the basis of results from a single case-control study, a four-week regimen of PEP should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure, depending on the risk of seroconversion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	There is no direct evidence to support the use of multi-drug antiretroviral regimens following occupational exposure to HIV.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	However, due to the success of combination therapies in treating HIV-infected individuals, a combination of antiretroviral drugs should be used for PEP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	Healthcare workers should be counseled about expected adverse events and the strategies for managing these.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	They should also be advised that PEP is not 100% effective in preventing HIV seroconversion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	A randomized controlled clinical trial is neither ethical nor practical.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	Due to the low risk of HIV seroconversion, a very large sample size would be required to have enough power to show an effect.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	More rigorous evaluation of adverse events, especially in the developing world, are required.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002835.pub3	Seeing that current practice is partly based on results from individual primary animal studies, we recommend a formal systematic review of all relevant animal studies.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD007407.pub3	CBT is effective in altering mood and catastrophising outcomes, when compared with treatment as usual/waiting list, with some evidence that this is maintained at six months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007407.pub3	Behaviour therapy has no effects on mood, but showed an effect on catastrophising immediately post-treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007407.pub3	CBT is a useful approach to the management of chronic pain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007407.pub3	There is no need for more general RCTs reporting group means: rather, different types of studies and analyses are needed to identify which components of CBT work for which type of patient on which outcome/s, and to try to understand why.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	All initiatives except one used an uncontrolled pre-post study design.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	Because of high levels of study heterogeneity (I2 > 90%), we focused on individual initiatives rather than on pooled results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	Ten initiatives provided sufficient data for quantitative analysis of impact (64,798 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	As required by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method, we graded the evidence as very low due to the risk of bias of the included studies, as well as variation in the direction and size of effect across the studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	Five of these showed mean decreases in average daily salt intake per person from pre-intervention to post-intervention, ranging from 1.15 grams/day less (Finland) to 0.35 grams/day less (Ireland).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	Two initiatives showed mean increase in salt intake from pre-intervention to post-intervention: Canada (1.66) and Switzerland (0.80 grams/day more per person); however in both countries the pre-intervention data point was from several years prior to the initiation of the intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	The remaining initiatives did not show a statistically significant mean change.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	Seven of the 10 initiatives were multi-component and incorporated intervention activities of a structural nature (e.g. food product reformulation, food procurement policy in specific settings).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	Of those seven initiatives, four showed a statistically significant mean decrease in salt intake from pre-intervention to post-intervention, ranging from Finland to Ireland (see above), and one showed a statistically significant mean increase in salt intake from pre-intervention to post-intervention (Switzerland; see above).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	Nine initiatives permitted quantitative analysis of differential impact by sex (men and women separately).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	For women, three initiatives (China, Finland, France) showed a statistically significant mean decrease, four (Austria, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom) showed no significant change and two (Canada, United States) showed a statistically significant mean increase in salt intake from pre-intervention to post-intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	For men, five initiatives (Austria, China, Finland, France, United Kingdom) showed a statistically significant mean decrease, three (Netherlands, Switzerland, United States) showed no significant change and one (Canada) showed a statistically significant mean increase in salt intake from pre-intervention to post-intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	Information was insufficient to indicate whether a differential change in mean salt intake occurred from pre-intervention to post-intervention by other axes of equity included in the PROGRESS framework (e.g. education, place of residence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	We identified no adverse effects of these initiatives.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	The number of initiatives was insufficient to permit other subgroup analyses, including stratification by intervention type, economic status of country and duration (or start year) of the initiative.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	We could perform a sensitivity analysis only for impact.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	Population-level interventions in government jurisdictions for dietary sodium reduction have the potential to result in population-wide reductions in salt intake from pre-intervention to post-intervention, particularly if they are multi-component (more than one intervention activity) and incorporate intervention activities of a structural nature (e.g. food product reformulation), and particularly amongst men.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010166.pub2	Heterogeneity across studies was significant, reflecting different contexts (population and setting) and initiative characteristics.	0

Amitriptyline versus placebo for masseteric electromyography (EMG) activity per minute: standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.28 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.91 to 0.34; P value = 0.37), 2. bromocriptine versus placebo for bruxism episodes per hour: mean difference (MD) 0.60 (95% CI -2.93 to 4.13), bruxism bursts per hour: MD -2.00 (95% CI -53.47 to 49.47), bruxism bursts per episode: MD 0.50 (95% CI -1.85 to 2.85) or number of episodes with grinding noise: MD 2.40 (95% CI -24.00 to 28.80), 3. clonidine versus placebo for number of bruxism episodes per hour: MD -2.41 (95% CI -4.84 to 0.02), 4. propranolol versus placebo for the number of bruxism episodes per hour: MD 1.16 (95% CI -1.89 to 4.21), 5. L-tryptophan versus placebo for masseteric EMG activity per second: SMD 0.08 (95% CI -0.90 to 1.06) and 6. levodopa versus placebo for bruxism episodes per hour of sleep: MD -1.47 (95% CI -3.64 to 0.70), for bruxism bursts per episode: MD 0.06 (95% CI -2.47 to 2.59).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	We combined several secondary outcomes (sleep duration, masseteric EMG activity per minute and pain intensity) in a meta-analysis for comparison of amitriptyline with placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	The results for most comparisons were uncertain because of statistical imprecision.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	One study reported that clonidine reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage and increased the second stage of sleep.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	However, results for other sleep-related outcomes with clonidine were uncertain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	Adverse effects were frequent in people who took amitriptyline (5/10 had drowsiness, difficulty awakening in the morning, insomnia or xerostomia compared with 0/10 in the placebo group), as well as in people who received propranolol (7/16 had moderate-to-severe xerostomia compare with 2/16 in the placebo group).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	Clonidine was associated with prolonged morning hypotension in three of 16 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	The use of preventive medication avoided any adverse effects in people treated with levodopa and bromocriptine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	There was insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of sleep bruxism.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	This systematic review points to the need for more, well-designed, RCTs with larger sample sizes and adequate methods of allocation, outcome assessment and duration of follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	Ideally, parallel RCTs should be used in future studies to avoid the bias associated with cross-over studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005578.pub2	There is a need to standardize the outcomes of RCTs on treatments for sleep bruxism.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	We identified 10 randomized controlled trials with 1015 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	All studies compared an enteral formula or additional supplemental omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and antioxidants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	We assessed some of the included studies as having high risk of bias due to methodological shortcomings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	Studies were heterogenous in nature and varied in several ways, including type and duration of interventions given, calorific targets, and reported outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	All studies reported mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	For the primary outcome, study authors reported no differences in all-cause mortality (longest period reported) with the use of an immunonutrition enteral formula or additional supplements of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.07; participants = 1015; studies = 10; low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	For secondary outcomes, we are uncertain whether immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants reduces ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) -3.09 days.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	95% CI -5.19 to -0.99; participants = 639; studies = 8; very low-quality evidence) and ventilator days (MD -2.24 days, 95% CI -3.77 to -0.71; participants = 581; studies = 7; very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	We are also uncertain whether omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants improve oxygenation, defined as ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO₂) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂), at day 4 (MD 39 mmHg, 95% CI 10.75 to 67.02; participants = 676; studies = 8), or whether they increase adverse events such as cardiac events (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.09 to 8.46; participants = 339; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence), gastrointestinal events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.75; participants = 427; studies = 4; very low-quality evidence), or total adverse events (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.23; participants = 517; studies = 5; very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	This meta-analysis of 10 studies of varying quality examined effects of omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants in adults with ARDS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	This intervention may produce little or no difference in all-cause mortality between groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	We are uncertain whether immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants improves the duration of ventilator days and ICU length of stay or oxygenation at day 4 due to the very low quality of evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012041.pub2	Adverse events associated with immunonutrition are also uncertain, as confidence intervals include the potential for increased cardiac, gastrointestinal, and total adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	The 33 eligible studies largely compared open questions with checklist-type questions or rating scales.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	Two included participant interviews.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	Despite different designs, populations and details of questioning methods, the narrative review showed that more specific questioning of participants led to more AEs detected compared to a more general enquiry.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	A subset of six studies suggested that more severe, bothersome, or otherwise clinically relevant AEs were reported when an initial open enquiry was used, while some less severe, bothersome, or clinically relevant AEs were only reported with a subsequent specific enquiry.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	However, two studies showed that quite severe or debilitating AEs were only detected by an interview, while other studies did not find a difference in the nature of AEs between elicitation methods.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	No conclusions could be made regarding the impact of question method on the ability to detect a statistically significant difference between study groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	There was no common statistical rubric, but we were able to represent some effect measures as a risk ratio of the proportion of participants with at least one AE.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	This showed a lower level of reporting for open questions (O) compared to checklists (CL), with a range for the risk ratios of 0.12 to 0.64.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	This review supports concerns that methods to elicit participant-reported AEs influence the detection of these data.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	There was a risk for under-detection of AEs in studies using a more general elicitation method compared to those using a comprehensive method.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	These AEs may be important from a clinical perspective or for patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	This under-detection could compromise ability to pool AE data.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	However, the impact on the nature of the AE detected by different methods is unclear.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	The wide variety and low quality of methods to compare elicitation strategies limited this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	Future studies would be improved by using and reporting clear definitions and terminology for AEs (and other important variables), frequency and time period over which they were ascertained, how they were graded, assessed for a relationship to the study drug, coded, and tabulated/reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	While the many potential AE endpoints in a trial may preclude the development of general AE patient-reported outcome measurement instruments, much could also be learnt from how these employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to better understand data elicited.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000039.pub2	Any chosen questioning method needs to be feasible for use by both staff and participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	We identified 582 records from the databases and search strategies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	We found 10 further records by searching other resources (handsearching).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	We removed 211 duplicate records and screened 381 records (title and abstract) for inclusion in the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	We excluded 364 records based on the title and abstract and assessed 17 full-text articles.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	We excluded 15 studies: eight studies did not assess interventions to prevent SUDEP; five studies measured sensitivity of devices to detect GTCS but did not directly measure SUDEP; and two studies assessed risk factors for SUDEP but not interventions for preventing SUDEP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	One listed study is awaiting classification.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	We included one case-control study at serious risk of bias within a qualitative analysis in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	This study of 154 cases of SUDEP and 616 controls ascertained a protective effect for the presence of nocturnal supervision (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.53) and when a supervising person shared the same bedroom or when special precautions, for example a listening device, were used (unadjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.82).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	This effect was independent of seizure control.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	Non-SUDEP deaths; changes to anxiety, depression, and quality of life; and number of hospital attendances were not reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	We found very low-quality evidence of a preventative effect for nocturnal supervision against SUDEP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011792.pub2	Further research is required to identify the effectiveness of other current interventions, for example seizure detection devices, safety pillows, SSRIs, early surgical evaluation, educational programmes, and opiate and adenosine antagonists in preventing SUDEP in people with epilepsy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	Searches retrieved 35 references to 21 individual studies, of which seven (n = 208) were eligible for inclusion.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	One study was of parallel design with the remaining six being cross-over in design; participant numbers ranged from 17 to 75.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	The total study duration varied between four days and two years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	The age of participants ranged between seven and 63 years with a wide range of disease severity reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	Six studies enrolled participants who were clinically stable, whilst participants in one study had been hospitalised with an infective exacerbation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	All studies compared autogenic drainage to one (or more) other recognised airway clearance technique.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	Exercise is commonly used as an alternative therapy by people with cystic fibrosis; however, there were no studies identified comparing exercise with autogenic drainage.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	The quality of the evidence was generally low or very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	The main reasons for downgrading the level of evidence were the frequent use of a cross-over design, outcome reporting bias and the inability to blind participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	The review's primary outcome, forced expiratory volume in one second, was the most common outcome measured and was reported by all seven studies; only three studies reported on quality of life (also a primary outcome of the review).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	One study reported on adverse events and described a decrease in oxygen saturation levels whilst performing active cycle of breathing techniques, but not with autogenic drainage.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	Six of the seven included studies measured forced vital capacity and three of the studies used mid peak expiratory flow (per cent predicted) as an outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	Six studies reported sputum weight.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	Less commonly used outcomes included oxygen saturation levels, personal preference, hospital admissions or intravenous antibiotics.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	There were no statistically significant differences found between any of the techniques used with respect to the outcomes measured except when autogenic drainage was described as being the preferred technique of the participants in one study over postural drainage and percussion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	Autogenic drainage is a challenging technique that requires commitment from the individual.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	As such, this intervention merits systematic review to ensure its effectiveness for people with cystic fibrosis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	From the studies assessed, autogenic drainage was not found to be superior to any other form of airway clearance technique.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	Larger studies are required to better evaluate autogenic drainage in comparison to other airway clearance techniques in view of the relatively small number of participants in this review and the complex study designs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	The studies recruited a range of participants and were not powered to assess non-inferiority.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub2	The varied length and design of the studies made the analysis of pooled data challenging.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001848.pub4	Twenty five studies (1305 participants) were included in the review, of which 22 studies (1060 participants) contributed data to meta-analyses.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001848.pub4	Based on thirteen studies, psychological therapies, all using a CBT approach, were more effective than TAU/WL in achieving clinical response at post-treatment (RR 0.64, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.74), and also in reducing anxiety, worry and depression symptoms.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001848.pub4	No studies conducted longer-term assessments of CBT against TAU/WL. Six studies compared CBT against supportive therapy (non-directive therapy and attention-placebo conditions).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001848.pub4	No significant difference in clinical response was indicated between CBT and supportive therapy at post-treatment (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.70 to 1.06), however, significant heterogeneity was indicated, which was partly explained by the number of therapy sessions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001848.pub4	Psychological therapy based on CBT principles is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms for short-term treatment of GAD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001848.pub4	The body of evidence comparing CBT with other psychological therapies is small and heterogeneous, which precludes drawing conclusions about which psychological therapy is more effective.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001848.pub4	Further studies examining non-CBT models are required to inform health care policy on the most appropriate forms of psychological therapy in treating GAD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	Twelve trials (1,856 women) met the inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	Eight of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the remaining four trials compared progestogen administration with no treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials, conducted in India, Jordan, UK and USA.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	In five trials women had had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in seven trials women had suffered two or more consecutive miscarriages.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	Routes, dosage and duration of progestogen treatment varied across the trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	The majority of trials were at low risk of bias for most domains.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	Ten trials (1684 women) contributed data to the analyses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	The meta-analysis of all women, suggests that there may be a reduction in the number of miscarriages for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo/controls (average risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.00, 10 trials, 1684 women, moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	A subgroup analysis comparing placebo-controlled versus non-placebo-controlled trials, trials of women with three or more prior miscarriages compared to women with two or more miscarriages and different routes of administration showed no clear differences between subgroups for miscarriage.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	None of the trials reported on any secondary maternal outcomes, including severity of morning sickness, thromboembolic events, depression, admission to a special care unit, or subsequent fertility.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	There was probably a slight benefit for women receiving progestogen seen in the outcome of live birth rate (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13, 6 trials, 1411 women, moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	We are uncertain about the effect on the rate of preterm birth because the evidence is very low-quality (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.41, 4 trials, 256 women, very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	No clear differences were seen for women receiving progestogen for the other secondary outcomes including neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities or stillbirth.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	There may be little or no difference in the rate of low birthweight and trials did not report on the secondary child outcomes of teratogenic effects or admission to a special care unit.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5	For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages, supplementation with progestogen therapy may reduce the rate of miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	In total, we included 14 studies with 1298 participants: nine studies (704 participants) compared CM vs. control, and five studies (594 participants) compared MIB interventions vs. control.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	We did not find any studies that assessed other types of psychosocial interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	For the most part, it was unclear if included studies adequately controlled for biases within their studies as such information was not often reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	We assessed risk of bias in the included studies relating to participant selection, allocation concealment, personnel and outcome assessor blinding, and attrition.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	The included trials rarely captured maternal and neonatal outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	For studies that did measure such outcomes, no difference was observed in pre-term birth rates (RR 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.51; three trials, 264 participants, moderate quality evidence), maternal toxicity at delivery (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.65; two trials, 217 participants, moderate quality evidence), or low birth weight (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.43; one trial, 160 participants, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	However, the results did show that neonates remained in hospital for fewer days after delivery in CM intervention groups (RR -1.27, 95% CI -2.52 to -0.03; two trials, 103 participants, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	There were no differences observed at the end of studies in retention or abstinence (as assessed by positive drug test at the end of treatment) in any psychosocial intervention group compared to control (Retention: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06, nine trials, 743 participants, low quality evidence; and Abstinence: RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.73, three trials, 367 participants, low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	These results held for both CM and MIB combined.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to moderate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	The present evidence suggests that there is no difference in treatment outcomes to address drug use in pregnant women with use of psychosocial interventions, when taken in the presence of other comprehensive care options.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	However, few studies evaluated obstetrical or neonatal outcomes and rarely did so in a systematic way, making it difficult to assess the effect of psychosocial interventions on these clinically important outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006037.pub3	It is important to develop a better evidence base to evaluate psychosocial modalities of treatment in this important population.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012318.pub2	We identified 31 studies (44 reports) including 27,071 participants and two ongoing studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012318.pub2	The risk of bias in the studies was low or unclear for several domains.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012318.pub2	Compared to the transfemoral approach, the transradial approach reduced short-term net adverse clinical events (NACE) (i.e. assessed during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow-up) (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.94; 17,133 participants; 4 studies; moderate quality evidence), cardiac death (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.88; 11,170 participants; 11 studies; moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012318.pub2	However, short-term myocardial infarction was similar between both groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02; 19,430 participants; 11 studies; high quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012318.pub2	The transradial approach had a lower procedural success rate (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.98; 25,920 participants; 28 studies; moderate quality evidence), but was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95; 18,955 participants; 10 studies; high quality evidence), bleeding (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.74; 23,043 participants; 20 studies; low quality evidence), and access site complications (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.59; 16,112 participants; 24 studies; low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012318.pub2	Transradial approach for diagnostic CA or PCI (or both) in CAD may reduce short-term NACE, cardiac death, all-cause mortality, bleeding, and access site complications.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012318.pub2	There is insufficient evidence regarding the long-term clinical outcomes (i.e. beyond 30 days of follow-up).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	We identified two studies of palliative care interventions for people with advanced dementia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	We did not pool data due to the heterogeneity between the two trials in terms of the interventions and the settings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	The two studies measured 31 different outcomes, yet they did not measure the same outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	There are six ongoing studies that we expect to include in future versions of this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	Both studies were at high risk of bias, in part because blinding was not possible.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	This and small sample sizes meant that the overall certainty of all the evidence was very low.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	One individually randomised RCT (99 participants) evaluated the effect of a palliative care team for people with advanced dementia hospitalised for an acute illness.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	While this trial reported that a palliative care plan was more likely to be developed for participants in the intervention group (risk ratio (RR) 5.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 25.02), the plan was only adopted for two participants, both in the intervention group, while in hospital.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	The palliative care plan was more likely to be available on discharge in the intervention group (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.03 to 19.75).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	We found no evidence that the intervention affected mortality in hospital (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.13), decisions to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hospital or the clinical care provided during hospital admission, but for the latter, event rates were low and the results were associated with a lot of uncertainty.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	One cluster RCT (256 participants, each enrolled with a family carer) evaluated the effect of a decision aid on end-of-life feeding options on surrogate decision-makers of nursing home residents with advanced dementia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	Data for 90 participants (35% of the original study) met the definition of advanced dementia for this review and were re-analysed for the purposes of the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	In this subset, intervention surrogates had lower scores for decisional conflict measured on the Decisional Conflict Scale (mean difference -0.30, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.01, reduction of 0.3 to 0.4 units considered meaningful) and were more likely than participants in the control group to discuss feeding options with a clinician (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.64), but imprecision meant that there was significant uncertainty about both results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	Very little high quality work has been completed exploring palliative care interventions in advanced dementia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	There were only two included studies in this review, with variation in the interventions and in the settings that made it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis of data for any outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	Thus, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of palliative care interventions in advanced dementia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011513.pub2	The fact that there are six ongoing studies at the time of this review indicates an increased interest in this area by researchers, which is welcome and needed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005212.pub3	Three trials reporting two different sequencing comparisons were identified.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005212.pub3	There were no significant differences between the various methods of sequencing adjuvant therapy for local recurrence-free survival, overall survival, relapse-free survival and metastasis-free survival based on 1166 randomised women in three trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005212.pub3	Concurrent chemoradiation increased anaemia (OR 1.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 2.15), telangiectasia (OR 3.85; 95% CI 1.37 to 10.87) and pigmentation (OR 15.96; 95% CI 2.06 to 123.68).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005212.pub3	Treated women did not report worse cosmesis with concurrent chemoradiation but physician-reported assessments did (OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.42 to 3.07).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005212.pub3	Other measures of toxicity did not differ between the two types of sequencing.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005212.pub3	On the basis of one trial (244 women), RT before CT was associated with an increased risk of neutropenic sepsis (OR 2.96; 95% CI 1.26 to 6.98) compared with CT before RT, but other measures of toxicity did not differ.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005212.pub3	The data included in this review, from three well-conducted randomised trials, suggest that different methods of sequencing CT and RT do not appear to have a major effect on recurrence or survival for women with breast cancer if RT is commenced within seven months after surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	We evaluated nine RCTs involving a total of 622 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	The RCTs were conducted in the community setting, with interventions mainly delivered by health professionals, and had a short- to medium-term follow up (up to 24 weeks).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	Three RCTs compared CrP plus resistance or weight training with placebo plus resistance or weight training, the other RCTs compared CrP alone versus placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	We focused this review on investigating which dose of CrP would prove most effective versus placebo and therefore assessed the results according to CrP dose.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	However, in order to find out if CrP works in general, we also analysed the effect of all pooled CrP doses versus placebo on body weight only.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	Across all CrP doses investigated (200 µg, 400 µg, 500 µg, 1000 µg) we noted an effect on body weight in favour of CrP of debatable clinical relevance after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment: mean difference (MD) -1.1 kg (95% CI -1.7 to -0.4); P = 0.001; 392 participants; 6 trials; low-quality evidence (GRADE)).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	No firm evidence and no dose gradient could be established when comparing different doses of CrP with placebo for various weight loss measures (body weight, body mass index, percentage body fat composition, change in waist circumference).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	Only three studies provided information on adverse events (low-quality evidence (GRADE)).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	There were two serious adverse events and study dropouts in participants taking 1000 µg CrP, and one serious adverse event in an individual taking 400 µg CrP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	Two participants receiving placebo discontinued due to adverse events; one event was reported as serious.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	No study reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2	We found no current, reliable evidence to inform firm decisions about the efficacy and safety of CrP supplements in overweight or obese adults.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	Eleven studies with a total of 886 participants were included in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	These evaluated a range of comparisons in a range of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	In general studies were small and some did not present data or analyses that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	These factors reduced the quality of the evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	Two comparisons compared different iodine preparations with no antiseptic treatment and found no clear evidence of effects for these treatments.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	The outcome data available were limited and what evidence there was low quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	One study compared a zinc oxide mesh dressing with a plain mesh dressing.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	There was no clear evidence of a difference in time to wound healing between groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	There was some evidence of a difference in measures used to assess wound infection (wound with foul smell and number of participants prescribed antibiotics) which favoured the zinc oxide group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	This was low quality evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	One study reported that sucralfate cream increased the likelihood of healing open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy compared to a petrolatum cream (RR: 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.99) over a three week period.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	This evidence was graded as being of moderate quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	The study also reported lower wound pain scores in the sucralfate group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	There was a reduction in time to healing of open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy when treated with Triclosan post-operatively compared with a standard sodium hypochlorite solution (mean difference -1.70 days, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.01).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	This was classed as low quality evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	There was moderate quality evidence that more open wounds resulting from excision of pyomyositis abscesses healed when treated with a honey-soaked gauze compared with a EUSOL-soaked gauze over three weeks' follow-up (RR: 1.58, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.42).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	There was also some evidence of a reduction in the mean length of hospital stay in the honey group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	Evidence was taken from one small study that only had 43 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	There was moderate quality evidence that more Dermacym®-treated post-operative foot wounds in people with diabetes healed compared to those treated with iodine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.93).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	Again estimates came from one small study with 40 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	There is no robust evidence on the relative effectiveness of any antiseptic/antibiotic/anti-bacterial preparation evaluated to date for use on SWHSI.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	Where some evidence for possible treatment effects was reported, it stemmed from single studies with small participant numbers and was classed as moderate or low quality evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2	This means it is likely or very likely that further research will have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change this estimate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008678.pub2	We included five randomised studies with total of 1049 women evaluating five different technique modifications during either amniocentesis (three studies) or CVS (two studies).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008678.pub2	For amniocentesis three interventions were evaluated - intramuscular progesterone, hexoprenaline and selecting high or low puncture sites for late 'blind' procedure - each intervention in a single small study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008678.pub2	There was no conclusive evidence of benefit for any of them.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008678.pub2	The same applies for terbutaline tocolysis and use of continuous vacuum aspiration during CVS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008678.pub2	Overall, the quality of evidence summarised in this review is not of sufficient quality to change current clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008678.pub2	In the absence of clear evidence, the operators should continue to use methods and technique modifications with which they are most familiar with.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008678.pub2	Any randomised trials of technique modifications that are performed to high standard with adequate safety outcomes and power to detect important clinical differences would be clearly welcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	We included 10 studies: four provided data for quantitative analyses (437 participants); five studies were randomised trials (1182 participants); three studies were non-RCTs (1181 participants, 8037 live births); two studies were interrupted time series (ITS) studies (1 study population of 2,242,438, 1 study unreported).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Six studies were conducted in upper-middle-income countries (China, Mexico, South Africa), one study was conducted in a lower-middle-income country (Bangladesh), and three studies were conducted in a high-income country (Canada).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Seven studies examined wheat flour fortified with folic acid alone or with other micronutrients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Three studies included maize flour fortified with folic acid alone or with other micronutrients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	The duration of interventions ranged from two weeks to 36 months, and the ITS studies included postfortification periods of up to seven years.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Most studies had unclear risk of bias for randomisation, blinding, and reporting, and low/unclear risk of bias for attrition and contamination.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Neural tube defects: none of the included RCTs reported neural tube defects as an outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	In one non-RCT, wheat flour fortified with folic acid and other micronutrients was associated with significantly lower occurrence of total neural tube defects, spina bifida, and encephalocoele, but not anencephaly, compared to unfortified flour (total neural tube defects risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.48; 1 study, 8037 births; low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Folate status: pregnant women who received folic acid-fortified maize porridge had significantly higher erythrocyte folate concentrations (mean difference (MD) 238.90 nmol/L, 95% CI 149.40 to 328.40); 1 study, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and higher plasma folate (MD 14.98 nmol/L, 95% CI 9.63 to 20.33; 1 study, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence), compared to no intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Women of reproductive age consuming maize flour fortified with folic acid and other micronutrients did not have higher erythrocyte folate (MD -61.80 nmol/L, 95% CI -152.98 to 29.38; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or plasma folate (MD 0.00 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.00; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) concentrations, compared to women consuming unfortified maize flour.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Adults consuming folic acid-fortified wheat flour bread rolls had higher erythrocyte folate (MD 0.66 nmol/L, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.19; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and plasma folate (MD 27.00 nmol/L, 95% CI 15.63 to 38.37; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence), versus unfortified flour.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	In two non-RCTs, serum folate concentrations were significantly higher among women who consumed flour fortified with folic acid and other micronutrients compared to women who consumed unfortified flour (MD 2.92 nmol/L, 95% CI 1.99 to 3.85; 2 studies, 657 participants; very low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Haemoglobin or anaemia: in a cluster-randomised trial among children, there were no significant effects of fortified wheat flour flatbread on haemoglobin concentrations (MD 0.00 nmol/L, 95% CI -2.08 to 2.08; 1 study, 334 participants; low-certainty evidence) or anaemia (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.55; 1 study, 334 participants; low-certainty evidence), compared to unfortified wheat flour flatbread.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Fortification of wheat flour with folic acid may reduce the risk of neural tube defects; however, this outcome was only reported in one non-RCT.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Fortification of wheat or maize flour with folic acid (i.e. alone or with other micronutrients) may increase erythrocyte and serum/plasma folate concentrations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Evidence is limited for the effects of folic acid-fortified wheat or maize flour on haemoglobin levels or anaemia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	The effects of folic acid fortification of wheat or maize flour on other primary outcomes assessed in this review is not known.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	No studies reported on the occurrence of adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2	Limitations of this review were the small number of studies and participants, limitations in study design, and low-certainty of evidence due to how included studies were designed and reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Searches identified six trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Two trials involving 1,124,483 neonates (210 with CF) with a maximum follow up of 17 years were eligible for inclusion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Varying study designs, outcomes reported and summary measures precluded calculation of pooled estimates and only data from one study were analysed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Severe malnutrition was less common among screened participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Compared with screened participants, the odds ratio of weight below the tenth percentile was 4.12 (95% CI 1.64 to 10.38) and for height was 4.62 (95% CI 1.69 to 12.61) in the control group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	At age seven, 88% of screened participants and 75% of controls had lung function parameters within normal limits of at least 89% predicted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	At diagnosis chest radiograph scores were significantly better among screened participants; 33% of screened versus 50% of control participants had Wisconsin chest X-ray (WCXR) scores over five (P = 0.097) and 24% of screened versus 45% of control participants had Brasfield chest X-ray (BCXR) scores under 21 (P = 0.042)).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Over time, chest radiograph scores were worse in the screened group (WCXR P = 0.017 and BCXR P = 0.041).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Results were no longer significant after adjustment for genotype, pancreatic status, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-culture results.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	In screened participants colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred earlier.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Two randomised controlled trials assessing neonatal screening in CF were identified; data from one study were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Nutritional benefits are apparent.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Screening provides potential for better pulmonary outcomes, but confounding factors influenced long-term pulmonary prognosis of people with CF.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2	Screening seems less expensive than traditional diagnosis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	We found five randomized trials, recruiting a total of 7314 participants and with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	Only one trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'lower' (< 120 mmHg) or 'standard' (< 140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure targets in 4734 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mmHg vs 133.5/70.5 mmHg, P < 0.0001), and using more antihypertensive medications, the only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a reduction in the incidence of stroke: risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.88, P = 0.009, absolute risk reduction 1.1%.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	The effect of SBP targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk: RR 1.05 CI 0.84 to 1.30, low quality evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	Trying to achieve the 'lower' SBP target was associated with a significant increase in the number of other serious adverse events: RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.91, P < 0.00001, absolute risk increase 2.0%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	Four trials (ABCD-H, ABCD-N, ABCD-2V, and a subgroup of HOT) specifically compared clinical outcomes associated with 'lower' versus 'standard' targets for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in people with diabetes.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	Participants assigned to 'lower' DBP had a significantly lower achieved BP: 128/76 mmHg vs 135/83 mmHg, P < 0.0001.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	There was a trend towards reduction in total mortality in the group assigned to the 'lower' DBP target (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01), mainly due to a trend to lower non-cardiovascular mortality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	There was no difference in stroke (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05), in myocardial infarction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40) or in congestive heart failure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.92), low quality evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	End-stage renal failure and total serious adverse events were not reported in any of the trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	A sensitivity analysis of trials comparing DBP targets < 80 mmHg (as suggested in clinical guidelines) versus < 90 mmHg showed similar results.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	At the present time, evidence from randomized trials does not support blood pressure targets lower than the standard targets in people with elevated blood pressure and diabetes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008277.pub2	More randomized controlled trials are needed, with future trials reporting total mortality, total serious adverse events as well as cardiovascular and renal events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002302.pub2	Fourteen trials (709 participants) met the inclusion criteria for the review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002302.pub2	One study compared two different types of non-removable casts with no discernable difference between the groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002302.pub2	Seven studies (366 participants) compared non-removable casts with removable pressure-relieving devices.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002302.pub2	In five of those studies non-removable casts were associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of ulcers healed compared with the removable device (RR 1.17 95% CI 1.01 to 1.36: P value = 0.04).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002302.pub2	Two studies (98 participants) found that significantly more ulcers healed with non-removable casts than with dressings alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002302.pub2	Achilles tendon lengthening combined with a non-removable cast in one study resulted in significantly more healed ulcers at 7 months than non-removable cast alone (RR 2.23; 95% CI 1.32 to 3.76).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002302.pub2	More ulcers remained healed at two years in this group (RR 3.41; 95% CI 1.42 to 8.18).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002302.pub2	Other comparisons included surgical debridement of ulcers; felt fitted to the foot; felted foam dressings and none of these showed a statistically significant treatment effect in favour of the intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002302.pub2	Non-removable, pressure-relieving casts are more effective in healing diabetes related plantar foot ulcers than removable casts, or dressings alone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002302.pub2	Non-removable devices, when combined with Achilles tendon lengthening were more successful in one forefoot ulcer study than the use of a non-removable cast alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	Five RCTs describing six interventions (comprising a total of 235 participants) met the eligibility criteria for the review.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	Each study focused on breast cancer survivors.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	Data for our primary outcome of interest, cognitive function were not amenable to being pooled statistically.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	Cognitive training demonstrated beneficial effects on objectively assessed cognitive function (including processing speed, executive functions, cognitive flexibility, language, delayed- and immediate- memory), subjectively reported cognitive function and mental well-being.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	Compensatory strategy training demonstrated improvements on objectively assessed delayed-, immediate- and verbal-memory, self-reported cognitive function and spiritual quality of life (QoL).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	The meta-analyses of two RCTs (95 participants) did not show a beneficial effect from compensatory strategy training on physical well-being immediately (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59 to 0.83; I2= 67%) or two months post-intervention (SMD - 0.21, 95% CI -0.89 to 0.47; I2 = 63%) or on mental well-being two months post-intervention (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.34; I2 = 67%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	Lower mental well-being immediately post-intervention appeared to be observed in patients who received compensatory strategy training compared to wait-list controls (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.16; I2 = 0%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	We assessed the assembled studies using GRADE for physical and mental health outcomes and this evidence was rated to be low quality and, therefore findings should be interpreted with caution.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	Evidence for physical activity and meditation interventions on cognitive outcomes is unclear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	Overall, the, albeit low-quality evidence may be interpreted to suggest that non-pharmacological interventions may have the potential to reduce the risk of, or ameliorate, cognitive impairment following systemic cancer treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	Larger, multi-site studies including an appropriate, active attentional control group, as well as consideration of functional outcomes (e.g. activities of daily living) are required in order to come to firmer conclusions about the benefits or otherwise of this intervention approach.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011325.pub2	There is also a need to conduct research into cognitive impairment among cancer patient groups other than women with breast cancer.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	We found 12 records referring to six trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	We included five trials, all from the 1970s, randomising 343 participants.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	Only short-term data were available.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	Results from the included trials found that, in terms of global state improvement, when rated by a psychiatrist, there was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; participants = 208; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	One trial reported change scores on the mental state scale Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); no clear difference was observed (MD -0.40, 95% CI -1.41 to 0.61; participants = 182; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	Chlorpromazine appears no worse or better than piperacetazine regarding adverse effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	In both treatment groups, around 60% of participants experienced some sort of adverse effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33; participants = 74; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence), with approximately 40% of these participants experiencing some parkinsonism-type movement disorder (RR 0.95, CI 0.61 to 1.49; participants = 106; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	No clear difference in numbers of participants leaving the study early for any reason was observed (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.56; participants = 256; studies = 4; very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	No trial reported data for change in negative symptoms or economic costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	The results of this review show chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy, but data are based on very small numbers of participants and the evidence is very low quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	We can not make firm conclusions based on such data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	Currently, should clinicians and people with schizophrenia need to choose between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine they should be aware there is no good quality evidence to base decisions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011709.pub2	More high quality research is needed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007378.pub2	Five randomised trials were identified with a total of 207 participants, 102 to colorectal stenting and 105 to emergency surgery.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD007378.pub2	There was no statistically significant difference in overall complication rate in both groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007378.pub2	The complication rate was 39.22% in the colonic stent group and was 45.71% in the emergency surgery group.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD007378.pub2	The clinical success rate was statistically higher in emergency surgery group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007378.pub2	However, use of colorectal stents seems to be as safe in the malignant colorectal obstruction as the emergency surgery with no statistically significant difference in the mortality and morbidity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007378.pub2	Colorectal stents are associated with acceptable stent perforation, migration and obstruction rates.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007378.pub2	The advantages of colorectal stent includes shorter hospital stay and procedure time and less blood loss.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007378.pub2	However, due to the variability in the sample size and trial designs in the included studies, further randomised trials with bigger sample size and well defined trial design are needed to achieve the robust evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	We included nine RCTs (1867 women) comparing human albumin (seven RCTs) or HES (two RCTs) or mannitol (one RCT) versus placebo or no treatment for prevention of OHSS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	The evidence was very low to moderate quality for all comparisons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	The main limitations were imprecision, poor reporting of study methods, and failure to blind outcome assessment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	There was evidence of a beneficial effect of intravenous albumin on OHSS, though heterogeneity was substantial (Peto OR 0.67 95% CI 0.47 to 0.95, seven studies, 1452 high risk women; I² = 69%, very low quality evidence) .	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	This suggests that if the rate of moderate or severe OHSS with no treatment is 12%, it will be about 9% (6% to12%) with the use of intravenous albumin.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	However, there was evidence of a detrimental effect on pregnancy rates (Peto OR 0.72 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94, I² = 42%, seven studies 1069 high risk women, moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	This suggests that if the chance of pregnancy is 40% without treatment, it will be about 32% (27% to 38%) with the use of albumin.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	There was evidence of a beneficial effect of HES on OHSS (Peto OR 0.27 95% CI 0.12 to 0.59, I² = 0%, two studies, 272 women, very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	This suggests that if the rate of moderate or severe OHSS with no treatment is 16%, it will be about 5% (2% to 10%) with the use of HES.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	There was no evidence of an effect on pregnancy rates (Peto OR 1.20 95% CI 0.49 to 2.93, one study, 168 women, very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	There was evidence of a beneficial effect of mannitol on OHSS (Peto OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.64, one study, 226 women with PCOS, low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	This means that if the risk of moderate or severe OHSS with no treatment is 52%, it will be about 29% (19% to 41%) with mannitol.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	There was no evidence of an effect on pregnancy rates (Peto OR 0.85 95% CI 0.47 to 1.55; one study, 226 women, low quality evidence).	0

10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	Evidence suggests that the plasma expanders assessed in this review (human albumin, HES and mannitol) reduce rates of moderate and severe OHSS in women at high risk.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	Adverse events appear to be uncommon, but were too poorly reported to reach any firm conclusions, and there were no data on live birth.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	However, there was evidence that human albumin reduces pregnancy rates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001302.pub3	While there was no evidence that HES, or mannitol had any influence on pregnancy rates, the evidence of effectiveness was based on very few trials which need to be confirmed in additional, larger randomised controlled trials (RCTs) before they should be considered for routine use in clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	Ten studies involving 484 patients were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	There was no evidence suggesting superior efficacy of any one sclerosant over another, but there was evidence of superiority of sclerotherapy to placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	The evidence did not suggest an increase in patient satisfaction with any one agent versus another, but there was evidence that patients were less satisfied with placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	There was some evidence suggesting that polidocanol (POL) was more likely to cause adverse reactions at a concentration of 1% compared with lower concentrations or hypertonic saline, and that sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) was more likely to cause adverse reactions at a concentration of 1% compared with POL at 0.5%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	There was some evidence suggesting that STS was more painful than POL, heparsal (20% saline mixed with heparin 100 units/mL) or placebo, and that POL was no more painful than placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	Evidence from one study suggested that hypertonic saline (HS) was more painful than POL.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	The data were not suitable for meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	The evidence did not suggest superior efficacy or patient satisfaction for any one sclerosing agent used in the treatment of telangiectasias of the lower limbs, but the agents studied showed superiority to a normal saline placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	However, the amount of available evidence in this field is small and the overall methodological quality of the research was poor, as was the quality of reporting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	More research is needed to determine the optimal agent(s) and the ideal dosing to achieve the best results and maximize patient satisfaction.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008826.pub2	Future research efforts should incorporate more demographic data and symptom measures to allow for comparison with findings from observational studies, thereby aiding assessment of how various risk groups respond to treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	We included seven studies (241 participants) in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	Meta-analysis of these seven included studies was not possible due to heterogeneity of the treatments and because many of the studies did not provide sufficient statistical information with their results.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	Allocation and blinding methodology was poorly described in most studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	No study evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for preventing clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and cardiac arrhythmias; however there is evidence that several commonly used therapies effectively reduce serum potassium levels.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	Salbutamol administered via either nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) significantly reduced serum potassium compared with placebo.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	One study reported 1.2 mg salbutamol via MDI 1.2 mg produced a significant decrease in serum potassium beginning at 10 minutes (MD -0.20 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and a maximal decrease at 60 minutes (MD -0.34 mmol/L, P < 0.0001).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	Intravenous (IV) and nebulised salbutamol produced comparable effects (2 studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	When compared to other interventions, salbutamol had similar effect to insulin-dextrose (2 studies) but was more effective than bicarbonate at 60 minutes (MD -0.46 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.10; 1 study).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	Insulin-dextrose was more effective than IV bicarbonate (1 study) and aminophylline (1 study).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	Insulin-dextrose, bicarbonate and aminophylline were not studied in any placebo-controlled studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	None of the included studies evaluated the effect of IV calcium or potassium binding resins in the treatment of hyperkalaemia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	Evidence for the acute pharmacological management of hyperkalaemia is limited, with no clinical studies demonstrating a reduction in adverse patient outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	Of the studied agents, salbutamol via any route and IV insulin-dextrose appear to be most effective at reducing serum potassium.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	There is limited evidence to support the use of other interventions, such as IV sodium bicarbonate or aminophylline.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010344.pub2	The effectiveness of potassium binding resins and IV calcium salts has not been tested in RCTs and requires further study before firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Thirty-nine studies, enrolling 4216 participants, were included in this review, however only 30 studies, involving 3392 participants, contained enough data to be meta-analysed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Risk of bias was low or unclear for most domains in the majority of the included studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Studies compared antimicrobial lock solutions (antibiotic and non-antibiotic) to standard sealing solutions (usually heparin) of the CVC for HD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Fifteen studies used antibiotic lock solutions, 21 used non-antibiotic antimicrobial lock solutions, and 4 used both (antibiotic and non-antibiotic) lock solutions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Studies reported the incidence of CRI, catheter thrombosis, or both.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Antimicrobial lock solutions probably reduces CRI per 1000 catheter-days (27 studies: RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.53; I2 = 54%; low certainty evidence), however antimicrobial lock solutions probably makes little or no difference to the risk of thrombosis per 1000 catheter days (14 studies: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.22; I2 = 83%; very low certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Subgroup analysis of antibiotic and the combination of both lock solutions showed that both probably reduced CRI per 1000 catheter-days (13 studies: RR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.42; I2 = 47%) and risk of thrombosis per 1000 catheter-days (4 studies: RR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.49; I2 = 0%), respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Non-antibiotic antimicrobial lock solutions probably reduced CRI per 1000 catheter-days for tunnelled CVC (9 studies: RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.91) but probably made little or no difference with non-tunnelled CVC (4 studies: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.81).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Subgroup analyses showed that antibiotic (5 studies: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.38), non-antibiotic (8 studies: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.66), and the combination of both lock solutions (3 studies: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.81) made little or no difference to thrombosis per 1000 catheter-days compared to control lock solutions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Antibiotic antimicrobial and combined (antibiotic-non antibiotic) lock solutions decreased the incidence of CRI compared to control lock solutions, whereas non-antibiotic lock solutions reduce CRI only for tunnelled CVC.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	The effect on thrombosis incidence is uncertain for all antimicrobial lock solutions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010597.pub2	Our confidence in the evidence is low and very low; therefore, better-designed studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of antimicrobial lock solutions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	We identified 15 eligible studies (1098 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Of these, six investigated pre-emptive treatment versus placebo or treatment of CMV when disease occurred (standard care), eight looked at pre-emptive treatment versus antiviral prophylaxis, and one reported on oral versus intravenous pre-emptive treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Assessment of risk of bias identified that the processes reported for sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low risk of bias in only five and three studies, respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	All studies were considered to be at low risk of attrition bias, and seven studies were considered to be at low risk of bias for selective reporting.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Only one study reported adequate blinding of participants and personnel; no study reported blinding of outcome assessment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Compared with placebo or standard care, pre-emptive treatment significantly reduced the risk of CMV disease (6 studies, 288 participants: RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80) but not acute rejection (3 studies, 185 participants: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.12) or all-cause mortality (3 studies, 176 participants: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.30).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Comparative studies of pre-emptive therapy versus prophylaxis showed no significant differences in preventing CMV disease between pre-emptive and prophylactic therapy (7 studies, 753 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.74) but there was significant heterogeneity (I² = 63%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Leucopenia was significantly less common with pre-emptive therapy compared with prophylaxis (6 studies, 729 participants: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.90).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Other adverse effects did not differ significantly or were not reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	There were no significant differences in the risks of all-cause mortality, graft loss, acute rejection and infections other than CMV.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Few RCTs have evaluated the effects of pre-emptive therapy to prevent CMV disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Pre-emptive therapy is effective compared with placebo or standard care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Despite the inclusion of five additional studies in this update, the efficacy of pre-emptive therapy compared with prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease remains unclear due to significant heterogeneity between studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005133.pub3	Additional head-to-head studies are required to determine the relative benefits and harms of pre-emptive therapy and prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3	Three RCTs met our inclusion criteria: these investigated a total of 140 participants and ranged from six weeks to five months in duration.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3	All three studies were performed by the same trialist.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3	Overall, the risk of bias of these trials was unclear or high.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3	All RCTs compared the effect of sweet potato preparations with placebo on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3	There was a statistically significant improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at three to five months with 4 g/day sweet potato preparation compared to placebo (mean difference -0.3% (95% confidence interval -0.6 to -0.04); P = 0.02; 122 participants; 2 trials).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3	No serious adverse effects were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3	Diabetic complications and morbidity, death from any cause, health-related quality of life, well-being, functional outcomes and costs were not investigated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3	There is insufficient evidence about the use of sweet potato for type 2 diabetes mellitus.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3	In addition to improvement in trial methodology, issues of standardization and quality control of preparations - including other varieties of sweet potato - need to be addressed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3	Further observational trials and RCTs evaluating the effects of sweet potato are needed to guide any recommendations in clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	Our search identified 62 studies, of which 19 (440 participants) met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	Five randomised controlled studies (192 participants) were included in the meta-analysis; three were of cross-over design.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	The 14 remaining studies were cross-over studies with inadequate reports for complete assessment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	The study size ranged from seven to 65 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	The age of the participants ranged from six to 63 years (mean age 22.33 years).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	In 13 studies, follow up lasted a single day.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	However, there were two long-term randomised controlled studies with follow up of one to three years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	Most of the studies did not report on key quality items, and therefore, have an unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor blinding.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies blinded participants or the personnel applying the interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	However, most of the studies reported on all planned outcomes, had adequate follow up, assessed compliance, and used an intention-to-treat analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	Included studies compared the active cycle of breathing technique with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, high frequency chest compression devices, conventional chest physiotherapy, and positive expiratory pressure.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	Preference of technique varied: more participants preferred autogenic drainage over the active cycle of breathing technique; more preferred the active cycle of breathing technique over airway oscillating devices; and more were comfortable with the active cycle of breathing technique versus high frequency chest compression.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	No significant difference was seen in quality of life, sputum weight, exercise tolerance, lung function, or oxygen saturation between the active cycle of breathing technique and autogenic drainage or between the active cycle of breathing technique and airway oscillating devices.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	There was no significant difference in lung function and the number of pulmonary exacerbations between the active cycle of breathing technique alone or in conjunction with conventional chest physiotherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	All other outcomes were either not measured or had insufficient data for analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	There is insufficient evidence to support or reject the use of the active cycle of breathing technique over any other airway clearance therapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	Five studies, with data from eight different comparators, found that the active cycle of breathing technique was comparable with other therapies in outcomes such as participant preference, quality of life, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and number of pulmonary exacerbations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub4	Longer-term studies are needed to more adequately assess the effects of the active cycle of breathing technique on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and preference.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2	Eight RCTs with 733 women in total that compared brief co-incubation and the standard insemination protocol were included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2	Live birth was not reported in the included studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2	For ongoing pregnancy rate, there were 127 ongoing pregnancies in two trials including 426 women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2	The low quality evidence showed that brief co-incubation was associated with an increased ongoing pregnancy rate compared to the standard insemination protocol (pooled odds ratio (OR) 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.55 to 3.77; P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2	Measuring clinical pregnancy rate, there were 93 clinical pregnancies in three trials including 372 women.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2	The low quality evidence showed that brief co-incubation was associated with a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate than the overnight insemination protocol (pooled OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.45 to 3.85; P = 0.0006, I2 = 0%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2	For the miscarriage rate, there were six miscarriages in one trial including 167 women.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2	This low quality evidence suggested no significant difference in the odds of miscarriage between brief co-incubation and standard insemination (OR 1.98, 95% CI 0.35 to 11.09; P = 0.44).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2	This review has provided evidence that brief co-incubation of sperm and oocytes may improve the ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates for infertile women undergoing IVF cycles.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2	More RCTs are required to assess whether brief co-incubation would contribute to a higher live birth rate and a lower miscarriage rate compared to the standard overnight insemination protocol.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004503.pub2	In five studies, recruiting a total of 694 infants, a long IT was associated with a significant increase in air leak [typical RR 1.56 (1.25, 1.94), RD 0.13 (0.07, 0.20), NNT 8 (5, 14)].	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004503.pub2	There was no significant difference in the incidence of BPD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004503.pub2	Long IT was associated with an increase in mortality before hospital discharge that reached borderline statistical significance [typical RR 1.26 (1.00, 1.59), RD 0.07 (0.00, 0.13)].	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004503.pub2	Caution should be exercised in applying these results to modern neonatal intensive care, because the studies included in this review were conducted prior to the introduction of antenatal steroids, post natal surfactant and the use of synchronised modes of ventilatory support.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004503.pub2	Most of the participants had single pathology (HMD) and no studies examined the effects of IT on newborns ventilated for other reasons such as meconium aspiration and congenital heart disease (lungs with normal compliance).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004503.pub2	However, the increased rates of air leaks and deaths using long ITs are clinically important; thus, infants with poorly compliant lungs should be ventilated with a short IT.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	We included 33 studies involving 5110 patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	Predominantly, the studies were of low methodological quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	TFU has been applied in many patient groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	There is a large variety in the ways the TFU was performed (the health professionals who undertook the TFU, frequency, structure, duration, etc.).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	Many different outcomes have been measured, but only a few were measured across more than one study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	Effects are not constant across studies, nor within patient groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	Due to methodological and clinical diversity, quantitative pooling could only be performed for a few outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	Of the eight meta-analyses in this review, five showed considerable statistical heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	Overall, there was inconclusive evidence about the effects of TFU.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	The low methodological quality of the included studies means that results must be considered with caution.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	No adverse effects were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	Nevertheless, although some studies find that the intervention had favourable effects for some outcomes, overall the studies show clinically-equivalent results between TFU and control groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004510.pub3	In summary, we cannot conclude that TFU is an effective intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	We identified 38 eligible retention trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	Included trials evaluated six broad types of strategies to improve retention.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	These were incentives, communication strategies, new questionnaire format, participant case management, behavioural and methodological interventions.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	For 34 of the included trials, retention was response to postal and electronic questionnaires with or without medical test kits.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	For four trials, retention was the number of participants remaining in the trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	Included trials were conducted across a spectrum of disease areas, countries, healthcare and community settings.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	Strategies that improved trial retention were addition of monetary incentives compared with no incentive for return of trial-related postal questionnaires (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28, P value < 0.0001), addition of an offer of monetary incentive compared with no offer for return of electronic questionnaires (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.38, P value < 0.00001) and an offer of a GBP20 voucher compared with GBP10 for return of postal questionnaires and biomedical test kits (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22, P value < 0.005).	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	The evidence that shorter questionnaires are better than longer questionnaires was unclear (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08, P value = 0.07) and the evidence for questionnaires relevant to the disease/condition was also unclear (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14).	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	Although each was based on the results of a single trial, recorded delivery of questionnaires seemed to be more effective than telephone reminders (RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.87, P value = 0.02) and a 'package' of postal communication strategies with reminder letters appeared to be better than standard procedures (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.67, P value < 0.0001).	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	An open trial design also appeared more effective than a blind trial design for return of questionnaires in one fracture prevention trial (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63, P value = 0.0003).	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	There was no good evidence that the addition of a non-monetary incentive, an offer of a non-monetary incentive, 'enhanced' letters, letters delivered by priority post, additional reminders, or questionnaire question order either increased or decreased trial questionnaire response/retention.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	There was also no evidence that a telephone survey was either more or less effective than a monetary incentive and a questionnaire.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	As our analyses are based on single trials, the effect on questionnaire response of using offers of charity donations, sending reminders to trial sites and when a questionnaire is sent, may need further evaluation.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	Case management and behavioural strategies used for trial retention may also warrant further evaluation.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	Most of the retention trials that we identified evaluated questionnaire response.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	There were few evaluations of ways to improve participants returning to trial sites for trial follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	Monetary incentives and offers of monetary incentives increased postal and electronic questionnaire response.	0
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	Some other strategies evaluated in single trials looked promising but need further evaluation.	1
10.1002/14651858.MR000032.pub2	Application of the findings of this review would depend on trial setting, population, disease area, data collection and follow-up procedures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	We included eight RCTs that involved a total of 829 participants (416 and 413 participants in the pLMA and cLMA groups, respectively).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	We identified six cross-over studies that are awaiting classification; one is completed but has not been published, and data related to the first treatment period for the other five studies were not yet available.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	Seven included studies provided data related to the primary outcome, and eight studies provided data related to more than one secondary outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	Our analysis was hampered by the fact that a large proportion of the included studies reported no events in either study arm.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	No studies reported significant differences between devices in relation to the primary review outcome: failure to adequately mechanically ventilate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	We evaluated this outcome by assessing two variables: inadequate oxygenation (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 3.31; four studies, N = 617) and inadequate ventilation (not estimable; one study, N = 80).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	More time was required to establish an effective airway using pLMA (mean difference (MD) 10.12 seconds, 95% CI 5.04 to 15.21; P < 0.0001; I² = 73%; two studies, N = 434).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	Peak airway pressure during positive pressure ventilation was lower in cLMA participants (MD 0.84, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.67; P = 0.04; I² = 0%; four studies, N = 259).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	Mean oropharyngeal leak (OPL) pressure was higher in pLMA participants (MD 6.93, 95% CI 4.23 to 9.62; P < 0.00001; I² = 87%; six studies, N = 709).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	The quality of evidence for all outcomes, as assessed by GRADE score, is low mainly owing to issues related to blinding and imprecision.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	Data show no important differences between devices with regard to failure to insert the device, use of an alternate device, mucosal injury, sore throat, bronchospasm, gastric insufflation, regurgitation, coughing, and excessive leak.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	Data were insufficient to allow estimation of differences for obstruction related to the device.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	None of the studies reported postoperative nausea and vomiting as an outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	We are uncertain about the effects of either of the airway devices in terms of failure of oxygenation or ventilation because there were very few events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	Results were uncertain in terms of differences for several complications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	Low-quality evidence suggests that the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway makes a better seal and therefore may be more suitable than the Classic laryngeal mask airway for positive pressure ventilation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009026.pub2	The Classic laryngeal mask airway may be quicker to insert, but this is unlikely to be clinically meaningful.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	We included 19 RCTs, reported in 27 papers with a total of 1453 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Fifteen of these studies were not included in the previous review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	All 19 RCTs had follow-up ranging from one to five months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Participants were aged between four and 18 years from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Girls outnumbered boys in most trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Fourteen trials recruited children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders; five trials specifically recruited only children with irritable bowel syndrome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	The studies fell into four categories: trials of probiotic-based interventions (13 studies), trials of fibre-based interventions (four studies), trials of low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diets (one study), and trials of fructose-restricted diets (one study).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	We found that children treated with probiotics reported a greater reduction in pain frequency at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.12; 6 trials; 523 children).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	There was also a decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group at the same time point (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.15; 7 studies; 575 children).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	However, we judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality using GRADE due to an unclear risk of bias from incomplete outcome data and significant heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	We found that children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.47; 7 studies; 722 children).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	The estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was eight, meaning that eight children would need to receive probiotics for one to experience improvement in pain in this timescale.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	We judged the evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to significant heterogeneity.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Children with a symptom profile defined as irritable bowel syndrome treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.13; 4 studies; 344 children).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at three to six months postintervention compared to those receiving placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.43; 2 studies; 224 children).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	We judged the evidence for these two outcomes to be of moderate quality due to small numbers of participants included in the studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	We found that children treated with fibre-based interventions were not more likely to experience an improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than children given placebo (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.65; 2 studies; 136 children).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	There was also no reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo at the same time point (SMD -1.24, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.94; 2 studies; 135 children).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	We found only one study of low FODMAP diets and only one trial of fructose-restricted diets, meaning no pooled analyses were possible.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	We were unable to perform any meta-analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	With the exception of one study, all studies reported monitoring children for adverse events; no major adverse events were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Overall, we found moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting that probiotics may be effective in improving pain in children with RAP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of a holistic management strategy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	However, further trials are needed to examine longer-term outcomes and to improve confidence in estimating the size of the effect, as well as to determine the optimal strain and dosage.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Future research should also explore the effectiveness of probiotics in children with different symptom profiles, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	We found only a small number of trials of fibre-based interventions, with overall low-quality evidence for the outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	There was therefore no convincing evidence that fibre-based interventions improve pain in children with RAP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Further high-quality RCTs of fibre supplements involving larger numbers of participants are required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2	Future trials of low FODMAP diets and other dietary interventions are also required to facilitate evidence-based recommendations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	We included 22 studies involving 4490 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	All were randomised trials (3 were cluster RCTs), and 19 of the 22 studies had analysable outcome data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Seventeen of the studies had student populations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Most of the studies were at unclear or high risk of bias for all forms of bias except detection bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Findings from the five trials with discrimination outcomes (n = 1196) were mixed, with effects showing a reduction, increase or consistent with no evidence of effect.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	The median standardised mean difference (SMD) for the three trials (n = 394) with continuous outcomes was -0.25, with SMDs ranging from -0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.39 to -0.31) to -0.17 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.20).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Odds ratios (OR) for the two studies (n = 802) with dichotomous discrimination outcomes showed no evidence of effect: results were 1.30 (95% CI 0.53 to 3.19) and 1.19 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.65).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	The 19 trials (n = 3176) with prejudice outcomes had median SMDs favouring the intervention, at the three following time periods: -0.38 (immediate), -0.38 (1 week to 2 months) and -0.49 (6 to 9 months).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	SMDs for prejudice outcomes across all studies ranged from -2.94 (95% CI -3.52 to -2.37) to 2.40 (95% CI 0.62 to 4.18).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	The median SMDs indicate that mass media interventions may have a small to medium effect in decreasing prejudice, and are equivalent to reducing the level of prejudice from that associated with schizophrenia to that associated with major depression.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	The studies were very heterogeneous, statistically, in their populations, interventions and outcomes, and only two meta-analyses within two subgroups were warranted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Data on secondary outcomes were sparse.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Cost data were provided on request for three studies (n = 416), were highly variable, and did not address cost-effectiveness.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Two studies (n = 455) contained statements about adverse effects and neither reported finding any.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Mass media interventions may reduce prejudice, but there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects on discrimination.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Very little is known about costs, adverse effects or other outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Our review found few studies in middle- and low-income countries, or with employers or health professionals as the target group, and none targeted at children or adolescents.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	The findings are limited by the quality of the evidence, which was low for the primary outcomes for discrimination and prejudice, low for adverse effects and very low for costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	More research is required to establish the effects of mass media interventions on discrimination, to better understand which types of mass media intervention work best, to provide evidence about cost-effectiveness, and to fill evidence gaps about types of mass media not covered in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009453.pub2	Such research should use robust methods, report data more consistently with reporting guidelines and be less reliant on student populations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	We include 85 studies in our synthesis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	Forty-six studies explored the views and experiences of healthy pregnant or postnatal women, 17 studies explored the views and experiences of healthcare providers and 22 studies incorporated the views of both women and healthcare providers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	The studies took place in 41 countries, including eight high-income countries, 18 middle-income countries and 15 low-income countries, in rural, urban and semi-urban locations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	We developed 52 findings in total and organised these into three thematic domains: socio-cultural context (11 findings, five moderate- or high-confidence); service design and provision (24 findings, 15 moderate- or high-confidence); and what matters to women and staff (17 findings, 11 moderate- or high-confidence)	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	The third domain was sub-divided into two conceptual areas; personalised supportive care, and information and safety.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	We also developed two lines of argument, using high- or moderate-confidence findings:	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	For women, initial or continued use of ANC depends on a perception that doing so will be a positive experience.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	This is a result of the provision of good-quality local services that are not dependent on the payment of informal fees and that include continuity of care that is authentically personalised, kind, caring, supportive, culturally sensitive, flexible, and respectful of women’s need for privacy, and that allow staff to take the time needed to provide relevant support, information and clinical safety for the woman and the baby, as and when they need it.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	Women’s perceptions of the value of ANC depend on their general beliefs about pregnancy as a healthy or a risky state, and on their reaction to being pregnant, as well as on local socio-cultural norms relating to the advantages or otherwise of antenatal care for healthy pregnancies, and for those with complications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	Whether they continue to use ANC or not depends on their experience of ANC design and provision when they access it for the first time.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	The capacity of healthcare providers to deliver the kind of high-quality, relationship-based, locally accessible ANC that is likely to facilitate access by women depends on the provision of sufficient resources and staffing as well as the time to provide flexible personalised, private appointments that are not overloaded with organisational tasks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	Such provision also depends on organisational norms and values that overtly value kind, caring staff who make effective, culturally-appropriate links with local communities, who respect women’s belief that pregnancy is usually a normal life event, but who can recognise and respond to complications when they arise.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	Healthcare providers also require sufficient training and education to do their job well, as well as an adequate salary, so that they do not need to demand extra informal funds from women and families, to supplement their income, or to fund essential supplies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	This review has identified key barriers and facilitators to the uptake (or not) of ANC services by pregnant women, and in the provision (or not) of good-quality ANC by healthcare providers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	It complements existing effectiveness reviews of models of ANC provision and adds essential insights into why a particular type of ANC provided in specific local contexts may or may not be acceptable, accessible, or valued by some pregnant women and their families/communities.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	Those providing and funding services should consider the three thematic domains identified by the review as a basis for service development and improvement.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012392.pub2	Such developments should include pregnant and postnatal women, community members and other relevant stakeholders.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000277.pub3	Sixteen trials, involving 3361 patients, were included in the review; three of the studies were of magnesium sulphate in addition to nimodipine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000277.pub3	Overall, calcium antagonists reduced the risk of poor outcome: the relative risk (RR) was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.92); the corresponding number of patients needed to treat was 19 (95% CI 1 to 51).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000277.pub3	For oral nimodipine alone the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.81), for other calcium antagonists or intravenous administration of nimodipine the results were not statistically significant.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000277.pub3	Calcium antagonists reduced the occurrence of secondary ischaemia and showed a favourable trend for case fatality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000277.pub3	For magnesium in addition to standard treatment with nimodipine, the RR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00) for a poor outcome and 0.66 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.96) for clinical signs of secondary ischaemia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000277.pub3	Calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal SAH.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000277.pub3	The results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine; the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000277.pub3	The evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment, oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal SAH.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000277.pub3	Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000277.pub3	Magnesium sulphate is a promising agent but more evidence is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	We identified three RCTs including 739 children.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	They all used an age of one year as the cut-off point for pre-treatment risk stratification.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	The first updated search identified a manuscript reporting additional follow-up data for one of these RCTs, while the second update identified an erratum of this study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	There was a significant statistical difference in event-free survival in favour of myeloablative therapy over conventional chemotherapy or no further treatment (three studies, 739 patients; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	There was a significant statistical difference in overall survival in favour of myeloablative therapy over conventional chemotherapy or no further treatment (two studies, 360 patients; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	However, when additional follow-up data were included in the analyses the difference in event-free survival remained statistically significant (three studies, 739 patients; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.90), but the difference in overall survival was no longer statistically significant (two studies, 360 patients; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	The meta-analysis of secondary malignant disease and treatment-related death did not show any significant statistical differences between the treatment groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	Data from one study (379 patients) showed a significantly higher incidence of renal effects, interstitial pneumonitis and veno-occlusive disease in the myeloablative group compared to conventional chemotherapy, whereas for serious infections and sepsis no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	No information on quality of life was reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	In the individual studies we evaluated different subgroups, but the results were not univocal in all studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	All studies had some methodological limitations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	Based on the currently available evidence, myeloablative therapy seems to work in terms of event-free survival.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	For overall survival there is currently no evidence of effect when additional follow-up data are included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	No definitive conclusions can be made regarding adverse effects and quality of life, although possible higher levels of adverse effects should be kept in mind.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	A definitive conclusion regarding the effect of myeloablative therapy in different subgroups is not possible.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	This systematic review only allows a conclusion on the concept of myeloablative therapy; no conclusions can be made regarding the best treatment strategy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	Future trials on the use of myeloablative therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma should focus on identifying the most optimal induction and/or myeloablative regimen.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	The best study design to answer these questions is a RCT.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	These RCTs should be performed in homogeneous study populations (e.g. stage of disease and patient age) and have a long-term follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	Different risk groups, using the most recent definitions, should be taken into account.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	It should be kept in mind that recently the age cut-off for high risk disease was changed from one year to 18 months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	As a result it is possible that patients with what is now classified as intermediate-risk disease have been included in the high-risk groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	Consequently the relevance of the results of these studies to the current practice can be questioned.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006301.pub4	Survival rates may be overestimated due to the inclusion of patients with intermediate-risk disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	We identified eight randomised clinical trials (632 participants) that fulfilled our inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	All eight trials were at high risk of bias, and we rated the evidence as low to very low certainty.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	The mean age ranged from 16 years to 78 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	The proportion of men ranged from 60% to 75% and the proportion of people with stage III primary hepatocellular carcinoma ranged from 22% to 85%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	The median follow-up duration was 12 months (2 months to 38 months).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone may have reduced all-cause mortality at three years' follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.88; 552 participants; 7 trials; low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone may reduce the proportion of participants without tumour response (complete response plus partial response) (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.61; 632 participants; 8 trials; low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	Data, from one trial on health-related quality of life, favoured the TACE followed by 3-DCRT group, but the provided data were ill-defined (very low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	None of the trials reported serious adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	The results on non-serious adverse events were as follows:	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone showed no difference in the results for proportion of participants with leukopenia (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.34; 438 participants; 5 trials; very low-certainty evidence) and serum transaminases elevation (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.27; 280 participants; 4 trials; very low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	However, the proportion of participants with total bilirubin elevation was larger in the TACE followed by 3-DCRT group than in the TACE alone group (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.40; 172 participants; 2 trials; very low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	The rate of participants with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) without decline or normalisation was significantly lower in the TACE followed by 3-DCRT group than in the TACE group, but these data were from one trial only (Chi² = 7.24, P = 0.007; very low-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	TACE followed by 3-DCRT may be associated with lower all-cause mortality and increased tumour response, despite the increased toxicity expressed by a higher rise of total bilirubin.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	Our review findings should be considered with caution because of the methodological weaknesses in the included trials, resulting in low- to very low-certainty evidence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	Data on serious adverse events and health-related quality of life are lacking.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	We are also very much uncertain in the results of the reported non-serious adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012244.pub2	High-quality trials are needed to assess further the role of TACE followed by 3-DCRT for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005093.pub2	No eligible trials were identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005093.pub2	Fourteen studies that appeared to be relevant were excluded, as no study directly compared increased versus standard energy intakes in infants with CLD/BPD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005093.pub2	However, two excluded trials provided some insights into the topic.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005093.pub2	One study showed that infants with CLD/BPD who were fed formula enriched with protein and minerals had improved growth parameters up until the cessation of the intervention at three months of corrected age.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005093.pub2	The other study compared different energy density of formula but identical energy intake by setting different feed volumes for both groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005093.pub2	It showed that both groups were unable to achieve the pre-designated feed volumes and that there were no differences in growth, respiratory outcomes, oedema and the diuretic requirements.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005093.pub2	To date, no randomised controlled trials are available that examine the effects of increased versus standard energy intake for preterm infants with (or developing) CLD/BPD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005093.pub2	Research should be directed at evaluating the effects of various levels of energy intake on this group of infants on clinically important outcomes like mortality, respiratory status, growth and neurodevelopment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005093.pub2	The benefits and harms of various ways of increasing energy intake, including higher energy density of milk feed and/or fluid volume (clinically realistic target volume should be set), parenteral nutrition, and the use of various constituents of energy like carbohydrate, protein and fat for this purpose also need to be assessed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	Altogether 13 studies enrolling 2341 participants (and involving 2360 procedures) fulfilled the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	The quality of evidence was very low (subclavian vein N = 3) or low (subclavian vein N = 4, femoral vein N = 2) for most outcomes, moderate for one outcome (femoral vein) and high at best for two outcomes (subclavian vein N = 1, femoral vein N = 1).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	Most of the trials had unclear risk of bias across the six domains, and heterogeneity among the studies was significant.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	For the subclavian vein (nine studies, 2030 participants, 2049 procedures), two-dimensional ultrasound reduced the risk of inadvertent arterial puncture (three trials, 498 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.82; P value 0.02, I² = 0%) and haematoma formation (three trials, 498 participants, RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.76; P value 0.01, I² = 0%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	No evidence was found of a difference in total or other complications (together, US, USD), overall (together, US, USD), number of attempts until success (US) or first-time (US) success rates or time taken to insert the catheter (US).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	For the femoral vein, fewer data were available for analysis (four studies, 311 participants, 311 procedures).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	No evidence was found of a difference in inadvertent arterial puncture or other complications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	However, success on the first attempt was more likely with ultrasound (three trials, 224 participants, RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.22; P value < 0.0001, I² = 31%), and a small increase in the overall success rate was noted (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23; P value 0.06, I² = 50%).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	No data on mortality or participant-reported outcomes were provided.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	On the basis of available data, we conclude that two-dimensional ultrasound offers small gains in safety and quality when compared with an anatomical landmark technique for subclavian (arterial puncture, haematoma formation) or femoral vein (success on the first attempt) cannulation for central vein catheterization.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	Data on insertion by inexperienced or experienced users, or on patients at high risk for complications, are lacking.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011447	The results for Doppler ultrasound techniques versus anatomical landmark techniques are uncertain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	Fifteen studies were included using four different methods of administration of physostigmine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	Four studies, 29 people, used intravenous infusion; seven, 131 people, used a conventional oral form; four, 1456 people, used a controlled-release oral form, and one study of 181 people used a verum skin patch.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	Intravenous infusion	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	There are no usable results from the intravenous infusion trials, Oral form	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	The few results from the trials of the conventional oral form showed no benefit of physostigmine compared with placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	Controlled release	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	The results from two of the four studies of the controlled-release physostigmine apply only to a group of patients identified as responders in a pre-randomization titration period.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	The best dose physostigmine was associated with improvement on the ADAS-Cog score compared with placebo at 6, 12 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	There were statistically significantly higher numbers of patients from the physostigmine group withdrawing from the trial (22/183 vs 2/183)(OR 5.92, 95% confidence limits 2.59 to 13.54, p<0.0001) and suffering at least one event of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, dizziness, stomach pain, flatulence or sweating compared with placebo at 6 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	There were statistically significantly higher numbers of patients from the physostigmine group withdrawing from the trial due to adverse events (13/83 vs 5/93)(OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.15 to 8.07, p=0.02) and suffering at least one event of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, dizziness, stomach pain, tremor, asthenia or sweating compared with placebo at 12 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	When no attempt was made to identify responders and all relevant patients with Alzheimer's disease were randomized, fixed dose physostigmine (mean 33 mg/day) was associated with a statistically significantly higher number withdrawing (234/358 vs 31/117)(OR 4.82, 95% CI 3.17 to 7.33, p<0.00001), withdrawing due to adverse events (196/358 vs 10/117) (OR 6.54, 95%CI 4.29 to 9.95, p<0.00001) and suffering at least one event of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, dizziness, stomach pain, dyspepsia, sweating, asthenia, dyspnoea or abnormal dreaming, but with no benefit on cognition compared with placebo at 24 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	Verum patch	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	The double dose (delivering mean dose 12 mg/day) was associated with statistically significantly higher numbers suffering at least one adverse event of vomiting, nausea, or abdominal cramps, and the lower dose (delivering mean dose 5.7mg/day) was associated with statistically significantly higher numbers suffering gastrointestinal complaints compared with placebo at 24 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	There was no difference between physostigmine (higher and lower dose) and placebo for numbers improved (CGIC) at 24 weeks.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	The evidence of effectiveness of physostigmine for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease is limited.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001499	Even in a controlled release formulation designed to overcome the short half-life, physostigmine showed no convincing benefit and adverse effects remained common leading to a high rate of withdrawal.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	We included 13 trials involving a total of 16,112 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	Eleven trials recruited participants with history of coronary heart disease, two trials recruited participants with history of stroke, and one trial recruited participants with a mix of people with CVD.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	We judged overall risk of bias to be moderate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	The meta-analysis (including all fibrate trials) showed evidence for a protective effect of fibrates primarily compared to placebo for the primary composite outcome of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.94; participants = 16,064; studies = 12; I2 = 45%, fixed effect).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	Fibrates were moderately effective for preventing MI occurrence (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.93; participants = 13,942; studies = 10; I2 = 24%, fixed effect).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	Fibrates were not effective against all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06; participants = 13,653; studies = 10; I2 = 23%), death from vascular causes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05; participants = 13,653; studies = 10; I2 = 11%, fixed effect), and stroke events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.16; participants = 11,719; studies = 6; I2 = 11%, fixed effect).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	Excluding clofibrate trials, as the use of clofibrate was discontinued in 2002 due to safety concerns, the remaining class of fibrates were no longer effective in preventing the primary composite outcome (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.03; participants = 10,320; studies = 7; I2 = 50%, random effects).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	However, without clofibrate data, fibrates remained effective in preventing MI (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; participants = 8304; studies = 6; I2 = 47%, fixed effect).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	There was no increase in adverse events with fibrates compared to control.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	Subgroup analyses showed the benefit of fibrates on the primary composite outcome to be consistent irrespective of age, gender, and diabetes mellitus.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	Moderate evidence showed that the fibrate class can be effective in the secondary prevention of composite outcome of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal MI, and vascular death.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	However, this beneficial effect relies on the inclusion of clofibrate data, a drug that was discontinued in 2002 due to its unacceptably large adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2	Further trials of the use of fibrates in populations with previous stroke and also against a background treatment with statins (standard of care) are required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	Twelve trials involving 3285 healthy women at low risk of excessive bleeding undergoing elective CS (nine trials, 2453 participants) or spontaneous birth (three trials, 832 participants) satisfied inclusion criteria and contributed data to the analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	All participants received routine prophylactic uterotonics in accordance with the local guideline in addition to TA or placebo or no intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	Overall, included studies had moderate risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective reporting and low risk of bias for incomplete data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	The quality of evidence was also as assessed using GRADE.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	Blood loss greater than 400 mL or 500 mL, and more than 1000 mL was less common in women who received TA versus placebo or no intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.63, six trials, 1398 women; moderate quality evidence) and (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.71, six trials, 2093 women; moderate quality evidence), respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	TA was effective in decreasing the incidence of blood loss greater than 1000 mL in women who had undergone CS (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.78, four trials, 1534 women), but not vaginal birth (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.06, 1.36, two trials 559 women).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	The effect of TA on blood loss greater than 500 mL or 400 mL was more pronounced in the group of women having vaginal birth than in women who had CS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	Mean blood loss (from delivery until two hours postpartum) was lower in women who received TA versus placebo or no intervention (mean difference MD - 77.79 mL, 95% CI -97.95, -57.64, five trials, 1186 women) and this effect was similar following vaginal birth and CS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	Additional medical interventions (moderate quality evidence) and blood transfusions were less frequent in women receiving TA versus placebo or no interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	Mild side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness were more common with the use of TA (moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	The effect of TA on maternal mortality, severe morbidity and thromboembolic events is uncertain (low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	TA (in addition to uterotonic medications) decreases postpartum blood loss and prevents PPH and blood transfusions following vaginal birth and CS in women at low risk of PPH based on studies of mixed quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about serious side effects, but there is an increase in the incidence of minor side effects with the use of TA.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3	Effects of TA on thromboembolic events and mortality as well as its use in high-risk women should be investigated further.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	We identified 12 studies (2494 participants: 1586 children and 908 elderly) comparing amantadine and rimantadine with placebo, paracetamol (one trial: 69 children) or zanamivir (two trials: 545 elderly) to treat influenza A. Amantadine was effective in preventing influenza A in children (773 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.30).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	The assumed risk of influenza A in the control group was 10 per 100.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	The corresponding risk in the rimantadine group was one per 100 (95% CI 0 to 3).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	Nevertheless, the quality of the evidence was low and the safety of the drug was not well established.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	For treatment, rimantadine was beneficial in abating fever on day three of treatment in children: one selected study with low risk of bias, moderate evidence quality and 69 participants (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.91).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	The assumed risk was 38 per 100.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	The corresponding risk in the rimantadine group was 14 per 100 (95% CI 5 to 34).	0

10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	The assumed risk was 17 per 100.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	The corresponding risk in the rimantadine group was 7 per 100 (95% CI 2 to 23).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	There was no evidence of adverse effects caused by treatment with amantadine or rimantadine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	We found no studies assessing amantadine in the elderly.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002745.pub4	The quality of the evidence combined with a lack of knowledge about the safety of amantadine and the limited benefits of rimantadine, do not indicate that amantadine and rimantadine compared to control (placebo or paracetamol) could be useful in preventing, treating and shortening the duration of influenza A in children and the elderly.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011424.pub2	Nine trials, which included a total of 1512 women, met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD011424.pub2	It is uncertain whether endometrial injury improves the probability of pregnancy and live birth/ongoing pregnancy in women undergoing IUI or attempting to conceive via sexual intercourse.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011424.pub2	The pooled results should be interpreted with caution as we graded the quality of the evidence as either low or very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011424.pub2	The main reasons we downgraded the quality of the evidence were most included studies were at a high risk of bias and had an overall low level of precision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011424.pub2	Further well-conducted RCTs that recruit large numbers of participants and minimise internal bias are required to confirm or refute these findings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	We included four RCTs (3905 participants), all of which were at high risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	The studies all evaluated one comparison: professional oral care versus usual oral care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	We did not pool the results from one study (N = 834 participants), which was stopped at interim analysis due to lack of a clear difference between groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	We were unable to determine whether professional oral care resulted in a lower incidence rate of NHAP compared with usual oral care over an 18-month period (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.46; one study, 2513 participants analysed; low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	We were also unable to determine whether professional oral care resulted in a lower number of first episodes of pneumonia compared with usual care over a 24-month period (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.01; one study, 366 participants analysed; low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	There was low-quality evidence from two studies that professional oral care may reduce the risk of pneumonia-associated mortality compared with usual oral care at 24-month follow-up (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72, 507 participants analysed).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	We were uncertain whether or not professional oral care may reduce all-cause mortality compared to usual care, when measured at 24-month follow-up (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.15; one study, 141 participants analysed; very low-quality evidence).	1

10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	Although low-quality evidence suggests that professional oral care could reduce mortality due to pneumonia in nursing home residents when compared to usual care, this finding must be considered with caution.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	Evidence for other outcomes is inconclusive.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	We found no high-quality evidence to determine which oral care measures are most effective for reducing nursing home-acquired pneumonia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012416.pub2	Further trials are needed to draw reliable conclusions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Five RCTs (149 participants) met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	These studies assessed bismuth subsalicylate versus placebo, budesonide versus placebo, mesalazine versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate versus mesalazine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	The study which assessed mesalazine versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine and the study which assessed beclometasone dipropionate versus mesalazine were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	The study which compared bismuth subsalicylate versus us placebo was judged as low quality due to a very small sample size and limited data.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	The other 3 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Budesonide (9 mg/day for 6 to 8 weeks) was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of clinical and histological response.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Clinical response was noted in 88% of budesonide patients compared to 38% of placebo patients (2 studies; 57 participants; RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.33; GRADE = low).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Histological response was noted in 78% of budesonide patients compared to 33% of placebo patients (2 studies; 39 patients; RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 5.28; GRADE = low).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Forty-one patients were enrolled in the study assessing mesalazine (2.4 g/day) versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine (4 g/day).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Clinical response was noted in 85% of patients in the mesalazine group compared to 86% of patients in the mesalazine plus cholestyramine group (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.28; GRADE = low).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Five patients were enrolled in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks versus placebo).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	There were no differences in clinical (P=0.10) or histological responses (P=0.71) in patients treated with bismuth subsalicylate compared with placebo (GRADE = very low).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Forty-six patients were enrolled in the trial studying beclometasone dipropionate (5 mg/day or 10 mg/day) versus mesalazine (2.4 g/day).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	There were no differences in clinical remission at 8 weeks (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.24; GRADE = low) and 12 months of treatment (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.40 to 4.18; GRADE = very low).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Although patients receiving beclometasone dipropionate (84%) and mesalazine (86%) achieved clinical remission at 8 weeks, it was not maintained at 12 months (26% and 20%, respectively).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Adverse events reported in the budesonide studies include nausea, vomiting, neck pain, abdominal pain, hyperhidrosis and headache.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Nausea and skin rash were reported as adverse events in the mesalazine study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Adverse events in the beclometasone dipropionate trial include nausea, sleepiness and change of mood.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	No adverse events were reported in the bismuth subsalicylate study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Low quality evidence suggests that budesonide may be effective for the treatment of active lymphocytic colitis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	This benefit needs to be confirmed by a large placebo -controlled trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	Low quality evidence also suggests that mesalazine with or without cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate may be effective for the treatment of lymphocytic colitis, however this needs to be confirmed by large placebo-controlled studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006096.pub4	No conclusions can be made regarding bismuth subsalicylate due to the very small number of patients in the study, Further trials studying interventions for lymphocytic colitis are warranted.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Twelve randomised controlled trials were included and evaluated outcomes in 3259 randomised patients.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Intervention duration ranged from 6 months (26 weeks) to 12 months (52 weeks).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Nine trials compared SMBG with usual care without monitoring, one study compared SMBG with SMUG, one study was a three-armed trial comparing SMBG and SMUG with usual care and one study was a three-armed trial comparing less intensive SMBG and more intensive SMBG with a control group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Seven out of 11 studies had a low risk of bias for most indicators.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Meta-analysis of studies including patients with a diabetes duration of one year or more showed a statistically significant SMBG induced decrease in HbA1c at up to six months follow-up (-0.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; 2324 participants, nine trials), yet an overall statistically non-significant SMBG induced decrease was seen at 12 month follow-up (-0.1; 95% CI -0.3 to 0.04; 493 participants, two trials).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Qualitative analysis of the effect of SMBG on well-being and quality of life showed no effect on patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Two trials reported costs of self-monitoring:	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	One trial compared the costs of self-monitoring of blood glucose with self-monitoring of urine glucose based on nine measurements per week and with the prices in US dollars for self-monitoring in 1990.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Authors concluded that total costs in the first year of self-monitoring of blood glucose, with the purchase of a reflectance meter were 12 times more expensive than self-monitoring of urine glucose ($481 or 361 EURO [11/2011 conversion] versus $40 or 30 EURO [11/2011 conversion]).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Another trial reported a full economical evaluation of the costs and effects of self-monitoring.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	At the end of the trial, costs for the intervention were £89 (104 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for standardized usual care (control group), £181 (212 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the less intensive self-monitoring group and £173 (203 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the more intensive self-monitoring group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Higher losses to follow-up in the more intensive self-monitoring group were responsible for the difference in costs, compared to the less intensive self-monitoring group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	There were few data on the effects on other outcomes and these effects were not statistically significant.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	None of the studies reported data on morbidity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	From this review, we conclude that when diabetes duration is over one year, the overall effect of self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin is small up to six months after initiation and subsides after 12 months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	Furthermore, based on a best-evidence synthesis, there is no evidence that SMBG affects patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3	More research is needed to explore the psychological impact of SMBG and its impact on diabetes specific quality of life and well-being, as well as the impact of SMBG on hypoglycaemia and diabetic complications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Eleven studies involving 471 participants with AsPD met the inclusion criteria, although data were available from only five studies involving 276 participants with AsPD.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Only two studies focused solely on an AsPD sample.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Eleven different psychological interventions were examined.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Only two studies reported on reconviction, and only one on aggression.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Compared to the control condition, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) plus standard maintenance was superior for outpatients with cocaine dependence in one study, but CBT plus treatment as usual was not superior for male outpatients with recent verbal/physical violence in another.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Contingency management plus standard maintenance was superior for drug misuse for outpatients with cocaine dependence in one study but not in another, possibly because of differences in the behavioural intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	However, contingency management was superior in social functioning and counselling session attendance in the latter.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	A multi-component intervention utilising motivational interviewing principles, the ‘Driving Whilst Intoxicated program’, plus incarceration was superior to incarceration alone for imprisoned drink-driving offenders.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Results suggest that there is insufficient trial evidence to justify using any psychological intervention for adults with AsPD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Disappointingly few of the included studies addressed the primary outcomes defined in this review (aggression, reconviction, global functioning, social functioning, adverse effects).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Three interventions (contingency management with standard maintenance; CBT with standard maintenance; 'Driving Whilst Intoxicated program' with incarceration) appeared effective, compared to the control condition, in terms of improvement in at least one outcome in at least one study.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Each of these interventions had been originally developed for people with substance misuse problems.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Significant improvements were mainly confined to outcomes related to substance misuse.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	No study reported significant change in any specific antisocial behaviour.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007668.pub2	Further research is urgently needed for this prevalent and costly condition.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	This updated review included 11 studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	Six studies contributed to one or more analyses related to the common cold, with up to 1047 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	Five studies contributed to one or more analyses relating to purulent rhinitis, with up to 791 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	One study contributed only to data on adverse events and one met the inclusion criteria but reported only summary statistics without providing any numerical data that could be included in the meta-analyses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	Interpretation of the combined data is limited because some studies included only children, or only adults, or only males; a wide range of antibiotics were used and outcomes were measured in different ways.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	There was a moderate risk of bias because of unreported methods details or because an unknown number of participants were likely to have chest or sinus infections.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	Participants receiving antibiotics for the common cold did no better in terms of lack of cure or persistence of symptoms than those on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.51, (random-effects)), based on a pooled analysis of six trials with a total of 1047 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	The RR of adverse effects in the antibiotic group was 1.8, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.21, (random-effects).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	Adult participants had a significantly greater risk of adverse effects with antibiotics than with placebo (RR 2.62, 95% CI 1.32 to 5.18) (random-effects) while there was no greater risk in children (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.63).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	The pooled RR for persisting acute purulent rhinitis with antibiotics compared to placebo was 0.73 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.13) (random-effects), based on four studies with 723 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	There was an increase in adverse effects in the studies of antibiotics for acute purulent rhinitis (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.94).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	There is no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold or for persisting acute purulent rhinitis in children or adults.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	There is evidence that antibiotics cause significant adverse effects in adults when given for the common cold and in all ages when given for acute purulent rhinitis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD000247.pub3	Routine use of antibiotics for these conditions is not recommended.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	We included five trials (162 randomised participants); three were conducted in a hospital dermatology department.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	One study declared funding by a pharmaceutical company.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	Participants' ages ranged from 12 to 77 years; only two participants were younger than 15 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	Mean PASI score at baseline varied from 5.7 (i.e. mild) to 23 (i.e. severe) in four studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	Twenty-three of 162 participants had streptococcus-positive throat swab culture.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	We did not perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of participants' characteristics and interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	None of the trials measured our efficacy primary outcome, time-to-resolution, or the secondary outcome, risk of having at least one relapse at long-term follow-up.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	We rated the quality of the results as very low-quality evidence, due to high risk of bias (absence of blinding of participants and caregivers, and high risk of outcome reporting bias) and imprecision (single study data with a low number of events).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	Hence, we are very uncertain about the results presented.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	Guttate psoriasis	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	One three-armed trial (N = 43) assessed penicillin (50,000 international units (IU)/kg/day in three doses) versus erythromycin (250 mg four times per day) versus no treatment (treatment for 14 days, with six-week follow-up from start of treatment).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	Adverse events and the proportion of participants achieving clear or almost clear skin were not measured.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	One trial (N = 20) assessed penicillin (1.6 MU (million units) intramuscularly once a day) versus no treatment (six weeks of treatment, with eight-week follow-up from start of treatment).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	At six-week (short-term) follow-up, no adverse events were observed in either group, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants with clear or almost clear skin (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 5.85).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	One trial (N = 20) assessed rifampicin (300 mg twice daily) versus placebo (14-day treatment duration; six-week follow-up from start of treatment); none of the review outcomes were measured.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	These trials did not measure the proportion of participants achieving PASI 75 or PGA 1 to 2. Chronic plaque psoriasis	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	One trial (N = 50) assessed long-term azithromycin treatment (500 mg daily dose) versus vitamin C. Adverse events were reported in the azithromycin group (10 out of 30 had nausea and mild abdominal upset), but not in the vitamin C group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	The proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin was not measured.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	In the azithromycin group, 18/30 versus 0/20 participants in the vitamin C group reached PASI 75 at the end of 48 weeks of treatment (RR 25.06, 95% CI 1.60 to 393.59).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	One trial (N = 29) assessed tonsillectomy versus no treatment, with 24-month follow-up after surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	One participant in the tonsillectomy group had minor bleeding.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	At eight-week follow-up, 1/15 in the tonsillectomy group, and 0/14 in the no treatment group achieved PASI 90; and 3/15 participants in the tonsillectomy group, and 0/14 in the no treatment group achieved PASI 75 (RR 6.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 116.7).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	We found only five trials (N = 162), which assessed the effects of five comparisons (systemic antibiotic treatment (penicillin, azithromycin) or tonsillectomy).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	Two comparisons (erythromycin compared to no treatment, and rifampicin compared to placebo) did not measure any of the outcomes of interest.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	There was very low-quality evidence for the outcomes that were measured, Therefore, we are uncertain of both the efficacy and safety of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	The included trials were at unclear or high risk of bias and involved only a small number of unrepresentative participants, with limited measurement of our outcomes of interest.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	The studies did not allow investigation into the influence of Streptococcal infection, and a key intervention (amoxicillin) was not assessed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011571.pub2	Further trials assessing the efficacy and tolerance of penicillin V or amoxicillin are needed in children and young adults with guttate psoriasis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	We identified 12 RCTs enrolling 933 participants with MS; 464 were randomised to the vitamin D group, and 469 to the comparator group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	Eleven trials tested vitamin D₃, and one trial tested vitamin D₂. Vitamin D₃ had no effect on the annualised relapse rate at 52 weeks' follow-up (rate difference -0.05, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.07; I² = 38%; five trials; 417 participants; very low-quality evidence according to the GRADE instrument); on the Expanded Disability Status Scale at 52 weeks' follow-up (MD -0.25, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.10; I² = 35%; five trials; 221 participants; very low-quality evidence according to GRADE); and on MRI gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions at 52 weeks' follow-up (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.48; I² = 12%; two trials; 256 participants; very low-quality evidence according to GRADE).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	Vitamin D₃ did not increase the risk of serious adverse effects within a range of 26 to 52 weeks' follow-up (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04; I² = 35%; eight trials; 621 participants; low-quality evidence according to GRADE) or minor adverse effects within a range of 26 to 96 weeks' follow-up (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06; I² = 20%; eight trials; 701 participants; low-quality evidence according to GRADE).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	Three studies reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using different HRQOL scales.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	One study reported that vitamin D improved ratings on the psychological and social components of the HRQOL scale but had no effects on the physical components.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	The other two studies found no effect of vitamin D on HRQOL.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	Two studies reported fatigue using different scales.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	One study (158 participants) reported that vitamin D₃ reduced fatigue compared with placebo at 26 weeks' follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	The other study (71 participants) found no effect on fatigue at 96 weeks' follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	Seven studies reported on cytokine levels, four on T-lymphocyte proliferation, and one on matrix metalloproteinase levels, with no consistent pattern of change in these immunological outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	The randomised trials included in this review provided no data on time to first treated relapse, number of participants requiring hospitalisation owing to progression of the disease, proportion of participants who remained relapse-free, cognitive function, or psychological symptoms.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	To date, very low-quality evidence suggests no benefit of vitamin D for patient-important outcomes among people with MS.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	Vitamin D appears to have no effect on recurrence of relapse, worsening of disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and MRI lesions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	Effects on health-related quality of life and fatigue are unclear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	Vitamin D₃ at the doses and treatment durations used in the included trials appears to be safe, although available data are limited.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3	Seven ongoing studies will likely provide further evidence that can be included in a future update of this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	We identified seven new studies in this update.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	We excluded six, and one study is ongoing so also not included in this update.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	This review contains a total of 62 included studies, with 4241 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Thirty-six studies used a cross-over design ranging from one to 15 days, with the greatest number (11) for seven days for each arm of the trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Overall we judged the included studies to be at high risk of bias because the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were poorly reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	The primary outcomes for this review were participant-reported pain and pain relief.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Fifteen studies compared oral morphine modified release (Mm/r) preparations with morphine immediate release (MIR).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Fourteen studies compared Mm/r in different strengths; six of these included 24-hour modified release products.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Fifteen studies compared Mm/r with other opioids.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Six studies compared MIR with other opioids.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Two studies compared oral Mm/r with rectal Mm/r.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Three studies compared MIR with MIR by a different route of administration.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Two studies compared Mm/r with Mm/r at different times and two compared MIR with MIR given at a different time.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	One study was found comparing each of the following: Mm/r tablet with Mm/r suspension; Mm/r with non-opioids; MIR with non-opioids; and oral morphine with epidural morphine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	In the previous update, a standard of 'no worse than mild pain' was set, equivalent to a score of 30/100 mm or less on a visual analogue pain intensity scale (VAS), or the equivalent in other pain scales.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Eighteen studies achieved this level of pain relief on average, and no study reported that good levels of pain relief were not attained.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Morphine is an effective analgesic for cancer pain.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Pain relief did not differ between Mm/r and MIR.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Modified release versions of morphine were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the formulation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Daily doses in studies ranged from 25 mg to 2000 mg with an average of between 100 mg and 250 mg.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Dose titration was undertaken with both instant release and modified release products.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	A small number of participants did not achieve adequate analgesia with morphine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Adverse events were common, predictable, and approximately 6% of participants discontinued treatment with morphine because of intolerable adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	The quality of the evidence is generally poor.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Studies are old, often small, and were largely carried out for registration purposes and therefore were only designed to show equivalence between different formulations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	The conclusions have not changed for this update.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	The effectiveness of oral morphine has stood the test of time, but the randomised trial literature for morphine is small given the importance of this medicine.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Most trials recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide appropriate data for meta-analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Only a few reported how many people had good pain relief, but where it was reported, over 90% had no worse than mild pain within a reasonably short time period.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	The review demonstrates the wide dose range of morphine used in studies, and that a small percentage of participants are unable to tolerate oral morphine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	The review also shows the wide range of study designs, and inconsistency in cross-over designs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	Trial design was frequently based on titration of morphine or comparator to achieve adequate analgesia, then crossing participants over in cross-over design studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	It was not clear if these trials were sufficiently powered to detect any clinical differences between formulations or comparator drugs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	New studies added to the review for the previous update reinforced the view that it is possible to use modified release morphine to titrate to analgesic effect.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4	There is qualitative evidence that oral morphine has much the same efficacy as other available opioids.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	Fourteen trials were included, totalling 1260 participants, with 1361 trigger fingers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	The age of participants included in the studies ranged from 16 to 88 years; and the majority of participants were women (approximately 70%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	The average duration of symptoms ranged from three to 15 months, and the follow-up after the procedure ranged from eight weeks to 23 months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	The studies reported nine types of comparisons: open surgery versus steroid injections (two studies); percutaneous surgery versus steroid injection (five studies); open surgery versus steroid injection plus ultrasound-guided hyaluronic acid injection (one study); percutaneous surgery plus steroid injection versus steroid injection (one study); percutaneous surgery versus open surgery (five studies); endoscopic surgery versus open surgery (one study); and three comparisons of types of incision for open surgery (transverse incision of the skin in the distal palmar crease, transverse incision of the skin about 2–3 mm distally from distal palmar crease, and longitudinal incision of the skin) (one study).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	Most studies had significant methodological flaws and were considered at high or unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	The primary comparison was open surgery versus steroid injections, because open surgery is the oldest and the most widely used treatment method and considered as standard surgery, whereas steroid injection is the least invasive control treatment method as reported in the studies in this review and is often used as first-line treatment in clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	Compared with steroid injection, there was low-quality evidence that open surgery provides benefits with respect to less triggering recurrence, although it has the disadvantage of being more painful.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	Evidence was downgraded due to study design flaws and imprecision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	Based on two trials (270 participants) from six up to 12 months, 50/130 (or 385 per 1000) individuals had recurrence of trigger finger in the steroid injection group compared with 8/140 (or 65 per 1000; range 35 to 127) in the open surgery group, RR 0.17 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.33), for an absolute risk difference that 29% fewer people had recurrence of symptoms with open surgery (60% fewer to 3% more individuals); relative change translates to improvement of 83% in the open surgery group (67% to 91% better).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	At one week, 9/49 (184 per 1000) people had pain on the palm of the hand in the steroid injection group compared with 38/56 (or 678 per 1000; ranging from 366 to 1000) in the open surgery group, RR 3.69 (95% CI 1.99 to 6.85), for an absolute risk difference that 49% more had pain with open surgery (33% to 66% more); relative change translates to worsening of 269% (585% to 99% worse) (one trial, 105 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	Because of very low quality evidence from two trials we are uncertain whether open surgery improve resolution of trigger finger in the follow-up at six to 12 months, when compared with steroid injection (131/140 observed in the open surgery group compared with 80/130 in the control group; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.76); evidence was downgraded due to study design flaws, inconsistency and imprecision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	Low-quality evidence from two trials and few event rates (270 participants) from six up to 12 months of follow-up, we are uncertain whether open surgery increased the risk of adverse events (incidence of infection, tendon injury, flare, cutaneous discomfort and fat necrosis) (18/140 observed in the open surgery group compared with 17/130 in the control group; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.84) and neurovascular injury (9/140 observed in the open surgery group compared with 4/130 in the control group; RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.7 to 6.77).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	Twelve participants (8 versus 4) did not complete the follow-up, and it was considered that they did not have a positive outcome in the data analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	We are uncertain whether open surgery was more effective than steroid injection in improving hand function or participant satisfaction as studies did not report these outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	Low-quality evidence indicates that, compared with steroid injection, open surgical treatment in people with trigger finger, may result in a less recurrence rate from six up to 12 months following the treatment, although it increases the incidence of pain during the first follow-up week.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	We are uncertain about the effect of open surgery with regard to the resolution rate in follow-up at six to 12 months, compared with steroid injections, due high heterogeneity and few events occurred in the trials; we are uncertain too about the risk of adverse events and neurovascular injury because of a few events occurred in the studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009860.pub2	Hand function or participant satisfaction were not reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	Three RCTs, with 931 participants, tested different neoadjuvant treatments: RT alone; sequential RT and procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy; PCV chemotherapy alone; and temozolomide chemotherapy alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	None of the studies blinded participants or personnel, and, therefore, are considered at high risk of performance and detection bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	The studies were otherwise at low risk of bias.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	One study, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial, demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit for RT plus PCV, with a median OS of 3.5 years compared with 2.6 years in the RT alone arm (P value = 0.018).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	This result was reported 10 years after the conclusion of the enrolment, and was not apparent in the original 2008 Cochrane review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	Furthermore, with retrospective evaluation of biomarkers, codeletion of complete chromosome arms 1p and 19q and IDH-1 or -2 mutation were independent prognostic factors for OS in two of the RCTs (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and EORTC), and were predictive for OS in one trial (RTOG).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	The third trial (NOA-04) evaluated these biomarkers prospectively and found them prognostic for progression-free survival.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	Early PCV, either before or after RT, appears to improve OS of participants with AO or AOA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	Use of biomarkers including codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q with or without IDH-1 or -2 mutation identify a subset of people with increased sensitivity to combined PCV and RT.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	The important role of biomarkers was supported in all of the RCTs examined, and prospective evaluation should be undertaken in future studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007104.pub2	However, PCV was associated with significant grade 3 and 4 toxicities, and whether temozolomide can be substituted for this remains unclear.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	We included five trials with a total of 240 children aged one to 18 years with mild to moderate OSA (AHI 1 to 30 per hour).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	All trials were performed in specialised sleep medicine clinics at tertiary care centres.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	Follow-up time ranged from six weeks to four months.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	Three RCTs (n = 137) compared intranasal steroids against placebo; two RCTs compared oral montelukast against placebo (n = 103).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	We excluded one trial from the meta-analysis since the patients were not analysed as randomised.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	We also had concerns about selective reporting in another trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	We are uncertain about the difference in AHI (MD −3.18, 95% CI −8.70 to 2.35) between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo (2 studies, 75 participants; low-certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	In contrast, children receiving oral montelukast had a lower AHI (MD −3.41, 95% CI −5.36 to −1.45) compared to those in the placebo group (2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	We are uncertain whether the secondary outcomes are different between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo: desaturation index (MD −2.12, 95% CI −4.27 to 0.04; 2 studies, 75 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), respiratory arousal index (MD −0.71, 95% CI −6.25 to 4.83; 2 studies, 75 participants; low-certainty evidence), and nadir oxygen saturation (MD 0.59%, 95% CI −1.09 to 2.27; 2 studies, 75 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	Children receiving oral montelukast had a lower respiratory arousal index (MD −2.89, 95% CI −4.68 to −1.10; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and nadir of oxygen saturation (MD 4.07, 95% CI 2.27 to 5.88; 2 studies, 103 participants; high-certainty evidence) compared to those in the placebo group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	We are uncertain, however, about the difference in desaturation index (MD −2.50, 95% CI −5.53 to 0.54; 2 studies, 103 participants; low-certainty evidence) between the montelukast and placebo group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	Adverse events were assessed and reported in all trials and were rare, of minor nature (e.g. nasal bleeding), and evenly distributed between study groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	No study examined the avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA as an outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of OSA in children; they may have short-term beneficial effects on the desaturation index and oxygen saturation in children with mild to moderate OSA but the certainty of the benefit on the primary outcome AHI, as well as the respiratory arousal index, was low due to imprecision of the estimates and heterogeneity between studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	Montelukast has short-term beneficial treatment effects for OSA in otherwise healthy, non-obese, surgically untreated children (moderate certainty for primary outcome and moderate and high certainty, respectively, for two secondary outcomes) by significantly reducing the number of apnoeas, hypopnoeas, and respiratory arousals during sleep.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	In addition, montelukast was well tolerated in the children studied.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	The clinical relevance of the observed treatment effects remains unclear, however, because minimal clinically important differences are not yet established for polysomnography-based outcomes in children.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	Long-term efficacy and safety data on the use of anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in childhood are still not available.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	In addition, patient-centred outcomes like concentration ability, vigilance, or school performance have not been investigated yet.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	There are currently no RCTs on the use of other kinds of anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007074.pub3	Future RCTs should investigate sustainability of treatment effects, avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA, and long-term safety of anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children and include patient-centred outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	Three RCTs and three CCTs (including 1291 children) investigated the prevention of VTE (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) n = 134, antithrombin (AT) supplementation n = 37, low-dose warfarin n = 31, cryoprecipitate and/or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) supplementation n = 240, AT supplementation and LMWH n = 41).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	AT, cryoprecipitate and FFP were supplemented only in cases of AT or fibrinogen deficiency.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	Of the six included RCTs/CCTs, five investigated the prevention of VTE compared with no intervention (n = 737), and one CCT compared AT supplementation and LMWH with AT supplementation (n = 71).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	All studies had methodological limitations, and clinical heterogeneity between studies was noted.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	We found no significant effects of systemic treatments compared with no intervention in preventing (a)symptomatic VTE and no differences in adverse events (such as major and/or minor bleeding; none of the studies reported thrombocytopenia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT), death as a result of VTE, removal of CVC due to VTE, CVC-related infection, and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)) between experimental and control groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	Two studies with comparable participant groups and interventions were included for meta-analyses (n = 182).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	In the experimental group, 1/68 (1.5%) children were diagnosed with symptomatic VTE, as were 4/114 (3.5%) in the control group (best case scenario: risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 4.78).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	These studies also evaluated asymptomatic CVC-related VTE: In the experimental group, 22/68 (32.4%) were diagnosed with asymptomatic VTE, as were 35/114 (30.7%) in the control group (best case scenario: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.55).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	Heterogeneity was substantial for this analysis: I2 = 73%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	The attribution of LMWH to AT supplementation resulted in a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE (Fisher's exact test, two-sided P = 0.028) without bleeding complications; asymptomatic VTE, thrombocytopenia, HIT, HITT, death as a result of VTE, removal of CVC due to VTE, CVC-related infection and PTS were not assessed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	Four cohort studies were included for the evaluation of adverse events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	Three studies provided information on bleeding episodes:	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	One participant developed an ischaemo-haemorrhagic stroke.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	One study provided information on other adverse events: None occurred.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	We found no significant effects of systemic treatments compared with no intervention in preventing (a)symptomatic VTE in paediatric oncology patients with CVCs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	However, this could be a result of the low number of included participants, which resulted in low power.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	In one CCT, which compared one systemic treatment with another systemic treatment, we identified a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE with the addition of LMWH to AT supplementation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	All studies investigated the prevalence of major and/or minor bleeding episodes, and none found a significant difference between study groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	None of the studies reported thrombocytopenia, HIT, HITT, death as a result of VTE, removal of CVC due to VTE, CVC-related infection or PTS among participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	On the basis of currently available evidence, we are not able to give recommendations for clinical practise.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	Additional well-designed international RCTs are needed to further explore the effects of systemic treatments in preventing VTE.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	Future studies should aim for adequate power with attainable sample sizes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009160.pub2	The incidence of symptomatic VTE is relatively low; therefore, it might be necessary to select participants with thrombotic risk factors or to investigate asymptomatic VTE instead.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	Three trials with a total of 287 participants operated on for Type I or II TAAA were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	In the first trial of 98 participants, neurological deficits in the lower extremities occurred in 14 (30%) of CSFD group and 17 (33%) controls.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	The deficit was observed within 24 hours of the operation in 21 (68%), and from three to 22 days in 10 (32%) participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	CSFD did not have a significant benefit in preventing ischaemic injury to the spinal cord.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	The second trial of 33 participants used a combination of CSFD and intrathecal papaverine.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	It showed a statistically significant reduction in the rate of postoperative neurological deficit (P = 0.039), compared to controls.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	Analysis was undertaken after only one third of the estimated sample size had entered the trial.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	Paraplegia or paraparesis occurred in 9 of 74 participants (12.2%) in the control group versus 2 of 82 participants (2.7%) receiving CSFD (P = 0.03).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	Overall, CSFD resulted in an 80% reduction in the relative risk of postoperative deficits.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	Meta-analysis showed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.48 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.92).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	For CSFD-only trials, OR was 0.57 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.17) and for intention-to-treat analysis in CSFD-only studies, the OR remained unchanged.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003635.pub3	There are limited data supporting the role of CSFD in thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery for prevention of neurological injury.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	We included 13 RCTs, with a total of 662 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	We report the results of intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) here.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	Our primary outcomes of interest were as follows: Participant-rated global improvement, Percentage of participants reaching Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (which meant equal to or more than 75% reduction in PASI score), Withdrawal due to side-effects, and Clearance rate.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	In one RCT of NB-UVB compared with oral PUVA in participants with CPP, the difference in PASI 75 was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.32; N = 51; low quality).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	In three other RCTs of CPP, the clearance rates were inconsistent because in one, there was no difference between the groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12; N = 54), and in the other two, the clearance rates were statistically significantly in favour of oral PUVA: RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.93; N = 93 and RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; N = 100, respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	Pooled data from these three studies indicated that withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different between either group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.54; N = 247; low quality).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	The evidence from the comparison of NB-UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate for CPP was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left-right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the NB-UVB and bath PUVA groups (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.91; N = 92; low quality), while a parallel RCT favoured bath PUVA (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.71; N = 36; low quality).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no significant differences between NB-UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.56; N = 50; low quality).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	Two RCTs found NB-UVB plus retinoid (re-NB-UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re-PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or GP in terms of clearance rate (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.10; N = 90; low quality).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	One RCT in people with CPP found no significant differences between NB-UVB and selective BB-UVB in terms of clearance rate (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.13; N = 100; low quality) and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 27.87; N = 100; low quality).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	No studies reported our primary outcomes for NB-UVB compared with conventional BB-UVB.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	Current evidence is very heterogeneous and needs to be interpreted with caution.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	The clearance rate between oral PUVA and NB-UVB is inconsistent among the included studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	Evidence regarding NB-UVB versus bath PUVA is also inconsistent.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	Re-NB-UVB and re-PUVA are similarly effective for treating people with CPP or GP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	In practice, NB-UVB may be more convenient to use since exogenous photosensitiser is not required before phototherapy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	NB-UVB is considered ineffective for PPP in clinical practice, and a small RCT did not detect a statistically significant difference between NB-UVB and topical PUVA for clearing PPP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	NB-UVB seemed to be similar to selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009481.pub2	Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the long-term safety of NB-UVB.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	Twenty one eligible studies were identified with a total of 1525 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	About half of the trials had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation concealment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	One small trial showed that biofeedback plus exercises was better than exercises alone (RR for failing to achieve full continence 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	One small trial showed that adding biofeedback to electrical stimulation was better than electrical stimulation alone (RR for failing to achieve full continence 0.47, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.65).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	The combined data of two trials showed that the number of people failing to achieve full continence was significantly lower when electrical stimulation was added to biofeedback compared against biofeedback alone (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	Sacral nerve stimulation was better than conservative management which included biofeedback and PFMT (at 12 months the incontinence episodes were significantly fewer with sacral nerve stimulation (MD 6.30, 95% CI 2.26 to 10.34).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	There was not enough evidence as to whether there was a difference in outcome between any method of biofeedback or exercises.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	There are suggestions that rectal volume discrimination training improves continence more than sham training.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	Further conclusions are not warranted from the available data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	The limited number of identified trials together with methodological weaknesses of many do not allow a definitive assessment of the role of anal sphincter exercises and biofeedback therapy in the management of people with faecal incontinence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	We found some evidence that biofeedback and electrical stimulation may enhance the outcome of treatment compared to electrical stimulation alone or exercises alone.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	Exercises appear to be less effective than an implanted sacral nerve stimulator.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	While there is a suggestion that some elements of biofeedback therapy and sphincter exercises may have a therapeutic effect, this is not certain.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3	Larger well-designed trials are needed to enable safe conclusions.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	Thirty nine randomised trials were identified for inclusion in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	They were generally small and of poor or moderate quality reporting data on only few outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	Confidence intervals were all wide.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	The data from five trials were heterogeneous but tended to indicate a higher risk of (re)catheterisation if a catheter was not used postoperatively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	The data gave only an imprecise estimate of any difference in urinary tract infection.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	Urethral catheterisation versus suprapubic catheterisation	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	In six trials, a greater number of people needed to be recatheterised if a urethral catheter rather than a suprapubic one was used following surgery (RR 3.66, 95% CI 1.41 to 9.49).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	Shorter postoperative duration of catheter use versus longer duration	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	In 11 trials, the seven trials with data suggested fewer urinary tract infections when a catheter was removed earlier (for example 1 versus 3 days, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.87) with no pattern in respect of catheterisation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	Clamp and release policies before catheter removal versus immediate catheter removal	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	In a single small trial, the clamp-and-release group showed a significantly greater incidence of urinary tract infections (RR 4.00, 95% 1.55 to 10.29) and a delay in return to normal voiding (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.16 to 5.39).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	Despite reviewing 39 eligible trials, few firm conclusions could be reached because of the multiple comparisons considered, the small size of individual trials, and their low quality.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2	Whether or not to use a particular policy is usually a trade-off between the risks of morbidity (especially infection) and risks of recatheterisation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	Ten studies (3340 participants) were included in the review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	Seven studies compared aripiprazole monotherapy versus placebo (2239 participants); two of these included a third comparison arm—one study used lithium (485 participants) and the other used haloperidol (480 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	Two studies compared aripiprazole as an adjunctive treatment to valproate or lithium versus placebo as an adjunctive treatment (754 participants), and one study compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol (347 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	The overall risk of bias was unclear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	A high dropout rate from most trials (> 20% for each intervention in eight of the trials) may have affected the estimates of relative efficacy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	Evidence shows that aripiprazole was more effective than placebo in reducing manic symptoms in adults and children/adolescents at three and four weeks but not at six weeks (Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS); mean difference (MD) at three weeks (random effects) -3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.82 to -2.05; six studies; N = 1819, moderate quality evidence) - a modest difference.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	Aripiprazole was compared with other drug treatments in three studies in adults—lithium was used in one study and haloperidol in two studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	No statistically significant differences between aripiprazole and other drug treatments in reducing manic symptoms were noted at three weeks (YMRS MD at three weeks (random effects) 0.07, 95% CI -1.24 to 1.37; three studies; N = 972, moderate quality evidence) or at any other time point up to and including 12 weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	Compared with placebo, aripiprazole caused more movement disorders, as measured on the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS), on the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) and by participant-reported akathisia (high quality evidence), with more people requiring treatment with anticholinergic medication (risk ratios (random effects) 3.28, 95% CI 1.82 to 5.91; two studies; N = 730, high quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	Aripiprazole also led to more gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea (high quality evidence), and constipation) and caused more children/adolescents to have a prolactin level that fell below the lower limit of normal.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	Significant heterogeneity was present in the meta-analysis of movement disorders associated with aripiprazole and other treatments and was most likely due to the different side effect profiles of lithium and haloperidol.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	At the three-week time point, meta-analysis was not possible because of lack of data; however, at 12 weeks, haloperidol resulted in significantly more movement disorders than aripiprazole, as measured on the SAS, the BAS and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and by participant-reported akathisia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	By 12 weeks, investigators reported no difference between aripiprazole and lithium (SAS, BAS, AIMS), except in terms of participant-reported akathisia (RR 2.97, 95% CI 1.37 to 6.43; one study; N = 313).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	Aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania in a population that includes adults, children and adolescents, although its use leads to gastrointestinal disturbances and movement disorders.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005000.pub2	Comparative trials with medicines other than haloperidol and lithium are few, so the precise place of aripiprazole in therapy remains unclear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	Two RCTs evaluated urokinase lock treatment with concomitant systemic antibiotics (n = 56) versus systemic antibiotics alone (n = 48), and one CCT evaluated ethanol lock treatment with concomitant systemic antibiotics (n = 15) versus systemic antibiotics alone (n = 13).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	No RCTs or CCTs evaluating antibiotic lock treatments were identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	All studies had methodological limitations and clinical heterogeneity between studies was present.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	We found no evidence of significant difference between ethanol or urokinase lock treatments with concomitant systemic antibiotics and systemic antibiotics alone regarding the number of participants cured, the number of recurrent CVC-related infections, the number of days until the first negative blood culture, the number of CVCs prematurely removed, ICU admission and sepsis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	Not all studies were included in all analyses.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	No adverse events occurred in the five publications of cohort studies (one cohort was included in two publications) assessing this outcome; CVC malfunctioning occurred in three out of five publications of cohort studies assessing this outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	No significant effect of urokinase or ethanol lock in addition to systemic antibiotics was found.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	However, this could be due to low power or a too-short follow-up.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	The cohort studies identified no adverse events; some cohort studies reported CVC malfunctioning.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	No RCTs or CCTs were published on antibiotic lock treatment alone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008975.pub2	More well-designed RCTs are needed to further explore the effect of antibiotic or other lock treatments in the treatment of CVC-related infections in children with cancer.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD005106.pub4	There is moderate quality evidence (one trial, 348 participants) that an educational video of advice focusing on activation was more beneficial for acute whiplash-related pain when compared with no treatment at intermediate-term [RR 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.06)] but not long-term follow-up [0.89 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.21)].	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005106.pub4	There is low quality evidence (one trial, 102 participants) that a whiplash pamphlet on advice focusing on activation is less beneficial for pain reduction, or no different in improving function and global perceived improvement from generic information given out in emergency care (control) for acute whiplash at short- or intermediate-term follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005106.pub4	Low to very low quality evidence (nine trials using diverse educational approaches) showed either no evidence of benefit or difference for varied outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005106.pub4	Advice focusing on pain & stress coping skills and workplace ergonomics: Very low quality evidence (three trials, 243 participants) favoured other treatment or showed no difference spanning numerous follow-up periods and disorder subtypes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005106.pub4	Low quality evidence (one trial, 192 participants) favoured specific exercise training for chronic neck pain at short-term follow-up.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005106.pub4	Self-care strategies: Very low quality evidence (one trial, 58 participants) indicated that self-care strategies did not relieve pain for acute to chronic neck pain at short-term follow-up.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005106.pub4	With the exception of one trial, this review has not shown effectiveness for educational interventions, including advice to activate, advice on stress-coping skills, workplace ergonomics and self-care strategies.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD007578.pub2	No studies meeting the study design criteria were identified for inclusion in this Cochrane review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007578.pub2	Results of thematic synthesis	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007578.pub2	In total, 49 studies and pieces of literature meeting the same population, intervention and outcome criteria as the Cochrane review, but identified from the broader literature providing evidence on policy implementation and consumer experiences, were included and formed the basis of a thematic synthesis, and which is presented in appendices to this Cochrane review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007578.pub2	The thematic synthesis indicates that ideally communication may be considered as a longitudinal multicomponent programme, ensuring that notification and support are coordinated; that communication is tailored and responsive to need; and that activities to support individual risk communication, such as widespread education and monitoring of access to health care for those at risk, are in place.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007578.pub2	The thematic synthesis also indicates that poor communication practices may have negative impacts or cause harm, such as discrimination in accessing health care.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007578.pub2	There is insufficient rigorous evidence to determine the effects of interventions to notify people at CJD or vCJD risk and to support them subsequently, or to identify the best approach to communication in these situations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007578.pub2	The thematic synthesis can be used to inform policy and practice decisions for communicating with people at risk in the absence of rigorous evaluative studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	We included one randomised clinical trial (N = 304 randomised; 204 completed; 276 analysed) that evaluated opioids (prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone) versus placebo.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	After 12 weeks, RSL symptoms had improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRLSSS: MD -7.0; 95% CI -9.69 to -4.31 and the CGI: MD -1.11; 95% CI -1.49 to -0.73).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	More patients in the drug group than in the placebo group were drug responders (using the IRLSSS: RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.37 to 2.42 and the CGI: RR1.92; 95% ICI 1.49 to 2.48).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	The proportion of remitters was greater in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRLSSS: RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.45 to 3.16).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	Quality of life scores also improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (MD -0.73; 95% CI -1.1 to -0.36).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	Quality of sleep was improved more in the drug group measured by sleep adequacy (MD -0.74; 95% CI -1.15 to -0.33), and sleep quantity (MD 0.89; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.26).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	There was no difference between groups for daytime somnolence, trouble staying awake during the day, or naps during the day.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	More adverse events were reported in the drug group (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.39).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	The major adverse events were gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, and headache.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	Opioids seem to be effective for treating RLS symptoms, but there are no definitive data regarding the important problem of safety.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006941.pub2	This conclusion is based on only one study with a high dropout rate (low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006194.pub2	Fifteen heterogeneous trials, involving 1022 adults with dorsally displaced and potentially or evidently unstable distal radial fractures, were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006194.pub2	While all trials compared external fixation versus plaster cast immobilisation, there was considerable variation especially in terms of patient characteristics and interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006194.pub2	Methodological weaknesses among these trials included lack of allocation concealment and inadequate outcome assessment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006194.pub2	External fixation maintained reduced fracture positions (redisplacement requiring secondary treatment: 7/356 versus 51/338 (data from 9 trials); relative risk 0.17, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.32) and prevented late collapse and malunion compared with plaster cast immobilisation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006194.pub2	There was insufficient evidence to confirm a superior overall functional or clinical result for the external fixation group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006194.pub2	External fixation was associated with a high number of complications, such as pin-track infection, but many of these were minor.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006194.pub2	Probably, some complications could have been avoided using a different surgical technique for pin insertion.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006194.pub2	There was insufficient evidence to establish a difference between the two groups in serious complications such as reflex sympathetic dystropy: 25/384 versus 17/347 (data from 11 trials); relative risk 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 2.32.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006194.pub2	There is some evidence to support the use of external fixation for dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006194.pub2	Though there is insufficient evidence to confirm a better functional outcome, external fixation reduces redisplacement, gives improved anatomical results and most of the excess surgically-related complications are minor.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011455.pub2	Five studies (1127 patients) were included in our analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011455.pub2	Generally the risk of bias of the included studies was judged low or unclear; they addressed the research question and utilised a prospective randomised design.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011455.pub2	It is uncertain whether early stent removal verus late stent removal improved the incidence of MUC (5 studies, 1127 participants: RR 1.87, 95% CI 0.61 to 5.71; I2 = 21%; low certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011455.pub2	The incidence of UTI may be reduced in the early stent removal group (5 studies, 1127 participants: RR 0.49 95% CI 0.30 to 0.81; I2 = 59%; moderate certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011455.pub2	This possible reduction in the UTI incidence was only apparent if a BI stent was used, (3 studies, 539 participants, RR 0.45 95% CI 0.29 to 0.70; I2 = 13%; moderate certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011455.pub2	However, if an externalised PU stent was used there was no discernible difference in UTI incidence between the early and late group (2 studies, 588 participants: RR 0.60 95% CI 0.17, 2.03; I2 = 83%; low certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011455.pub2	Data on health economics and quality of life outcomes were lacking.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011455.pub2	Early removal of ureteric stents following kidney transplantation may reduce the incidence of UTI while it uncertain if there is a higher risk of MUC.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011455.pub2	BI stents are the optimum method for achieving this benefit.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non-restorative caries treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	Crowns versus fillings	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	All studies in this comparison used PMCs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	Crowns versus non-restorative caries treatment	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	Only one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non-restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	Metal crowns versus aesthetic crowns	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	One split-mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to non-restorative caries, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005512.pub3	There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	A total of 28 studies (involving 788 children and adults) were included in the review; 18 studies involving 296 participants were cross-over in design.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform any meta-analysis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	In 22 of the 28 studies the PEP technique was performed using a mask, in three of the studies a mouthpiece was used with nose clips and in three studies it was unclear whether a mask or mouthpiece was used.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	These studies compared PEP to ACBT, autogenic drainage (AD), oral oscillating PEP devices, high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and BiPaP and exercise.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	Forced expiratory volume in one second was the review's primary outcome and the most frequently reported outcome in the studies (24 studies, 716 participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	Single interventions or series of treatments that continued for up to three months demonstrated little or no difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on this outcome (low- to moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	However, long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on this outcome (low- to moderate-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	A second primary outcome was the number of respiratory exacerbations.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	There was a lower exacerbation rate in participants using PEP compared to other techniques when used with a mask for at least one year (five studies, 232 participants; moderate- to high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	In one of the included studies which used PEP with a mouthpiece, it was reported (personal communication) that there was no difference in the number of respiratory exacerbations (66 participants, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	Participant preference was reported in 10 studies; and in all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, this was in favour of PEP.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	The results for the remaining outcome measures (including our third primary outcome of mucus clearance) were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high-quality evidence; only very low- to moderate-quality evidence was available for other outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	There was limited evidence reported on adverse events; these were measured in five studies, two of which found no events.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	In a study where infants performing either PEP or PDPV experienced some gastro-oesophageal reflux , this was more severe in the PDPV group (26 infants, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	In PEP versus oscillating PEP, adverse events were only reported in the flutter group (five participants complained of dizziness, which improved after further instructions on device use was provided) (22 participants, low-quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	In PEP versus HFCWO, from one long-term high-quality study (107 participants) there was little or no difference in terms of number of adverse events; however, those in the PEP group had fewer adverse events related to the lower airways when compared to HFCWO (high-certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	Many studies had a risk of bias as they did not report how the randomisation sequence was either generated or concealed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	Most studies reported the number of dropouts and also reported on all planned outcome measures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	The evidence provided by this review is of variable quality, but suggests that all techniques and devices described may have a place in the clinical treatment of people with CF.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	Following meta-analyses of the effects of PEP versus other airway clearance techniques on lung function and patient preference, this Cochrane Review demonstrated that there was high-quality evidence that showed a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations when PEP using a mask was compared with HFCWO.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	It is important to note that airway clearance techniques should be individualised throughout life according to developmental stages, patient preferences, pulmonary symptoms and lung function.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5	This also applies as conditions vary between baseline function and pulmonary exacerbations.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	Four studies involving 1485 participants with moderate to severe CD met the inclusion criteria and were used in the meta-analyses.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	All studies included active CD patients with CDAI ranging from 220 to 450.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	Most patients were adults over 18 years of age.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	One study was identified as high risk of bias due to a non-identical placebo while the other studies were judged to be at low risk of bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	CZP (100 mg to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks) was shown to be superior to placebo for achieving clinical remission at week 8 (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.66; moderate certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	The raw numbers of participants achieving clinical remission at week 8 were 26.9% (225/835) and 19.8% (129/650) in the CZP and the placebo groups, respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	CZP was shown to be superior to placebo for achieving clinical response at week 8 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.53; moderate certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	In raw numbers, clinical response at week 8 was achieved in 40.2% (336/835) and 30.9% (201/650) of participants in the CZP and the placebo groups, respectively.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	In raw numbers, serious adverse events were observed in 8.7% (73/835) and 6.2% (40/650) of participants in the CZP and the placebo groups, respectively (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.97; moderate certainty evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	Serious adverse events included worsening Crohn's disease, infections, and malignancy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	Moderate certainty evidence suggests that CZP is effective for induction of clinical remission and clinical response in participants with active CD patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	It is uncertain whether the risk of serious adverse events differs between CZP and placebo as the 95% CI includes the possibility of a small decrease or doubling of events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012893.pub2	Future studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of CZP in CD patients.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	One hundred and twelve studies met our selection criteria: 15 were studies of adults with CKD; 16 studies were conducted in the general population but provided subgroup data for people with CKD; and 81 studies included individuals with CKD, however, data for this subgroup were not provided.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	The risk of bias in all 112 studies was frequently high or unclear.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	Of the 31 studies (23,762 participants) with data on CKD patients, follow-up ranged from three months to five years, and study size ranged from 16 to 2916 participants.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	In total, 26 studies (19,612 participants) reported disaggregated and extractable data on at least one outcome of interest for our review and were included in our meta-analyses.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	Treatment with beta-blockers may decrease hospitalisation for heart failure (3 studies, 2287 participants: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.05; I2 = 87%; low certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	Aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia compared to placebo or no treatment (3 studies, 826 participants: RR 2.91, 95% CI 2.03 to 4.17; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	Renin inhibitors had uncertain risks of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 142 participants: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.49; I2 = 0%; very low certainty).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	We were unable to estimate whether treatment with sinus node inhibitors affects the risk of hyperkalaemia, as there were few studies and meta-analysis was not possible.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	Hyperkalaemia was not reported for the CKD subgroup in studies investigating other therapies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	The effects of ACEi or ARB, or aldosterone antagonists on worsening heart failure or kidney function, hypotension, or quality of life were uncertain due to sparse data or were not reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	Effects of anti-arrhythmic agents, digoxin, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, renin inhibitors, sinus node inhibitors, vasodilators, and vasopressin receptor antagonists were very uncertain due to the paucity of studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	The effects of pharmacological interventions for heart failure in people with CKD are uncertain and there is insufficient evidence to inform clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	Study data for treatment outcomes in patients with heart failure and CKD are sparse despite the potential impact of kidney impairment on the benefits and harms of treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD012466.pub2	Future research aimed at analysing existing data in general population HF studies to explore the effect in subgroups of patients with CKD, considering stage of disease, may yield valuable insights for the management of people with HF and CKD.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006947.pub3	Three studies involving a total of 1945 women were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006947.pub3	Overall, risk of bias across the three trials was mixed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006947.pub3	No serious complications were reported in the trials and no neonatal or maternal deaths occurred.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006947.pub3	The neonatal outcome was not statistically different between groups: Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.83; three studies, n = 1945); umbilical artery pH less than 7.15 (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.79; one study, n = 1456); umbilical artery pH less than 7.16 (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.92; one study, n = 239); admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.67; two studies, n = 489); and more than 48 hours hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20; one study, n = 1456).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006947.pub3	The pooled risk for instrumental delivery (including caesarean section, ventouse and forceps extraction) was not statistically significantly different (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.21; three studies, n = 1945).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006947.pub3	Hyperstimulation was reported in two studies (n = 489), but there was no statistically significant difference between groups (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.88).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006947.pub3	This review found no differences between the two types of monitoring (internal or external tocodynamometry) for any of the maternal or neonatal outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006947.pub3	Given that this review is based on three studies (N = 1945 women) of moderate quality, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of one form of tocodynamometry over another for women where intravenous oxytocin was administered for induction or augmentation of labour.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	We included two trials involving 54 participants with CVI.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	The intensity of disease signs and symptoms was measured in both studies but using different scales; we were therefore unable to pool the data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups whereas the second reported a reduction in symptoms in the exercise group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	In one study, increases in change in ejection fraction compared with baseline (mean difference (MD) 4.88%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.16 to 6.60; 30 participants; P < 0.00001), half venous refilling time (MD 4.20 seconds, 95% CI 3.28 to 5.12; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) and total venous refilling time (MD 9.40 seconds, 95% CI 7.77 to 11.03; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) were observed in the exercise group compared with the control group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups with regard to quality of life or ankle range of motion.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	Although muscle strength assessed by dynamometry at slow speed did not differ between the two groups in this study, variable peak torque at fast speed was lower in the control group than in the exercise group (2.8 ± 0.9 compared with -0.3 ± 0.6, P < 0.03).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	The incidence of venous leg ulcers, incidence of surgical intervention to treat symptoms related to CVI and exercise capacity were not assessed or reported in either of the included trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	We rated both included studies as at high risk of bias; hence, these data should be interpreted carefully.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	Due to the small number of studies and small sample size, we were not able to verify indirectness and publication bias.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	There is currently insufficient evidence available to assess the efficacy of physical exercise in people with CVI.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010637.pub2	Future research into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of exercise protocols (intensity, frequency and time), sample size, blinding and homogeneity according to the severity of disease.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	Seventy-six trials with a median quality score of 3 (range 1 to 5) were identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	Follow-up periods varied between day of last injection and eighteen months.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	Forty trials included comparisons of hyaluronan/hylan and placebo (saline or arthrocentesis), ten trials included comparisons of intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, six trials included comparisons of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), three trials included comparisons of physical therapy, two trials included comparisons of exercise, two trials included comparisons of arthroscopy, two trials included comparisons of conventional treatment, and fifteen trials included comparisons of other hyaluronans/hylan.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	The pooled analyses of the effects of viscosupplements against 'placebo' controls generally supported the efficacy of this class of intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	In these same analyses, differential efficacy effects were observed for different products on different variables and at different timepoints.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	Of note is the 5 to 13 week post injection period which showed a percent improvement from baseline of 28 to 54% for pain and 9 to 32% for function.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	In general, comparable efficacy was noted against NSAIDs and longer-term benefits were noted in comparisons against IA corticosteroids.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	In general, few adverse events were reported in the hyaluronan/hylan trials included in these analyses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	Based on the aforementioned analyses, viscosupplementation is an effective treatment for OA of the knee with beneficial effects: on pain, function and patient global assessment; and at different post injection periods but especially at the 5 to 13 week post injection period.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	It is of note that the magnitude of the clinical effect, as expressed by the WMD and standardised mean difference (SMD) from the RevMan 4.2 output, is different for different products, comparisons, timepoints, variables and trial designs.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	However, there are few randomised head-to-head comparisons of different viscosupplements and readers should be cautious, therefore, in drawing conclusions regarding the relative value of different products.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	The clinical effect for some products, against placebo, on some variables at some timepoints is in the moderate to large effect-size range.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	Readers should refer to relevant tables to review specific detail given the heterogeneity in effects across the product class and some discrepancies observed between the RevMan 4.2 analyses and the original publications.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	Overall, the analyses performed are positive for the HA class and particularly positive for some products with respect to certain variables and timepoints, such as pain on weight bearing at 5 to 13 weeks postinjection.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	In general, sample-size restrictions preclude any definitive comment on the safety of the HA class of products; however, within the constraints of the trial designs employed no major safety issues were detected.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	In some analyses viscosupplements were comparable in efficacy to systemic forms of active intervention, with more local reactions but fewer systemic adverse events.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	In other analyses HA products had more prolonged effects than IA corticosteroids.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005321.pub2	Overall, the aforementioned analyses support the use of the HA class of products in the treatment of knee OA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	Ten randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with a total of 4052 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in this review.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	Four RCTs (1881 participants) compared misoprostol with placebo given in addition to conventional uterotonics.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	Adjunctive use of misoprostol (in the dose of 600 to 1000 mcg) with simultaneous administration of additional uterotonics did not provide additional benefit for our primary outcomes including maternal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 50.85), serious maternal morbidity (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31), admission to intensive care (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11) or hysterectomy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.16 to 5.41).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	Two RCTs (1787 participants) compared 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol versus oxytocin infusion as primary PPH treatment; one trial included women who had received prophylactic uterotonics, and the other did not.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	Primary outcomes did not differ between the two groups, although women given sublingual misoprostol were more likely to have additional blood loss of at least 1000 mL (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.75).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	Misoprostol was associated with a significant increase in vomiting and shivering.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	Two trials attempted to test the effectiveness of estrogen and tranexamic acid, respectively, but were too small for any meaningful comparisons of pre-specified outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	One study compared lower segment compression but was too small to assess impact on primary outcomes.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	We did not identify any trials evaluating surgical techniques or radiological interventions for women with primary PPH unresponsive to uterotonics and/or haemostatics.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	Clinical trials included in the current review were not adequately powered to assess impact on the primary outcome measures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	Compared with misoprostol, oxytocin infusion is more effective and causes fewer side effects when used as first-line therapy for the treatment of primary PPH.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	When used after prophylactic uterotonics, misoprostol and oxytocin infusion worked similarly.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	The review suggests that among women who received oxytocin for the treatment of primary PPH, adjunctive use of misoprostol confers no added benefit.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	The role of tranexamic acid and compression methods requires further evaluation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD003249.pub3	Furthermore, future studies should focus on the best way to treat women who fail to respond to uterotonic therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004869.pub2	Six trials fulfilled entry criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004869.pub2	The majority of patients in these trials were preterm.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD004869.pub2	One large multicenter RCT evaluated short-term N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN in extremely low birth weight infants (≤ 1000 grams).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004869.pub2	Growth was not significantly affected by cysteine supplementation (1 trial) or by N-acetylcysteine supplementation (1 trial).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004869.pub2	Nitrogen retention was significantly increased by cysteine supplementation (4 trials) (WMD 31.8 mg/kg/day, 95% confidence interval +8.2, +55.4, n = 95, including 73 preterm infants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004869.pub2	Plasma levels of cysteine were significantly increased by cysteine supplementation but not by N-acetylcysteine supplementation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004869.pub2	N-acetylcysteine supplementation did not significantly affect the risks of death by 36 postmenstrual weeks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), death or BPD, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), severe ROP, necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgery, periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), or severe IVH.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004869.pub2	Available evidence from RCTs shows that routine short-term cysteine chloride supplementation of cysteine-free PN in preterm infants improves nitrogen balance.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004869.pub2	However, there is insufficient evidence to assess the risks of cysteine supplementation, especially regarding metabolic acidosis, which has been reported during the first two weeks of cysteine chloride administration.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004869.pub2	Available evidence from a large RCT trial does not support routine N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN in extremely low birth weight infants.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD010803.pub2	The main sources of heterogeneity were thought likely to be reference standards used for the target disorders, sources of recruitment, participant sampling, index test methodology and aspects of study quality (particularly, inadequate blinding).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010803.pub2	We were not able to formally assess the effect of each potential source of heterogeneity as planned, due to the small number of studies available to be included.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010803.pub2	The insufficiency and heterogeneity of research to date primarily leads to a state of uncertainty regarding the value of CSF testing of t-tau, p-tau or p-tau/ABeta ratio for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in current clinical practice.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010803.pub2	Particular attention should be paid to the risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia (and therefore over-treatment) in clinical practice.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010803.pub2	These tests, like other biomarker tests which have been subject to Cochrane DTA reviews, appear to have better sensitivity than specificity and therefore might have greater utility in ruling out Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology to the individual's evident cognitive impairment, as opposed to ruling it in.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010803.pub2	The heterogeneity observed in the few studies awaiting classification suggests our initial summary will remain valid.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD010803.pub2	Future studies with more uniformed approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogenous estimate than the one that has been available from the included studies we have identified.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	We included three single-centre, two-arm RCTs involving 170 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	We found one ongoing trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	All included participants were male and were undergoing radical robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	The men were between 50 and 75 years of age and met criteria for American Society of Anesthesiologists physical classification scores (ASA) I, ll and III.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	We found evidence showing no clinically meaningful differences in postoperative pain between the two types of anaesthetics (mean difference (MD) in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at one to six hours was -2.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.62 to 6.22; P = 0.61) in a sample of 62 participants from one study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	Low-quality evidence suggests that propofol reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) over the short term (one to six hours after surgery) after RALRP compared with inhalational anaesthesia (sevoflurane, desflurane) (MD -1.70, 95% CI -2.59 to -0.81; P = 0.0002).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	We found low-quality evidence suggesting that propofol may prevent an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) after pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg positioning compared with sevoflurane (MD -3.90, 95% CI -6.34 to -1.46; P = 0.002) with increased IOP from baseline to 30 minutes in steep Trendelenburg.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	However, it is unclear whether this surrogate outcome translates directly to clinical avoidance of ocular complications during surgery.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	No studies addressed the secondary outcomes of adverse effects, all-cause mortality, respiratory or circulatory complications, cognitive dysfunction, length of stay or costs.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	Overall the quality of evidence was low to very low, as all studies were small, single-centre trials providing unclear descriptions of methods.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	It is unclear which anaesthetic technique is superior - TIVA or inhalational - for transabdominal robotic assisted surgery in urology, gynaecology and gastroenterology, as existing evidence is scarce, is of low quality and has been generated from exclusively male patients undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011387.pub2	An ongoing trial, which includes participants of both genders with a focus on quality of recovery, might have an impact on future evidence related to this topic.	1

10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	We conducted stratified analyses of mild or moderate potency, and potent or very potent topical corticosteroids, but we found no causal associations between maternal exposure to topical corticosteroid of any potency and congenital abnormality, orofacial clefts, preterm delivery, or low Apgar score.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	For low birth weight, although the meta-analysis based on study-level data was not significant for either mild to moderate corticosteroids (pooled RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09, 3 cohort studies, n > 55,713) or potent to very potent corticosteroids (pooled RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.58, 4 cohort studies, n > 47,651), there were significant differences between the two subgroups (P = 0.04).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	The results from three of the individual studies in the meta-analysis indicated an increased risk of low birth weight in women who received potent to very potent topical corticosteroids.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	Maternal use of mild to moderate potency topical steroids was associated with a decreased risk of foetal death (pooled RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.77, 2 studies, n = 48,749; low quality evidence), but we did not observe this effect when potent to very potent topical corticosteroids were given during pregnancy (pooled RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.88, 3 studies, n = 37,086, low quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	Data from observational studies started at low quality.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	We further downgraded the evidence because of imprecision in low birth weight and inconsistency in foetal death.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	Lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	This update adds more evidence showing no causal associations between maternal exposure to topical corticosteroids of all potencies and pregnancy outcomes including mode of delivery, congenital abnormalities, preterm delivery, foetal death, and low Apgar score, which is consistent with the previous version of this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	This update provides stratified analyses based on steroid potency; we found no association between maternal use of topical corticosteroids of any potency and an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including mode of delivery, congenital abnormality, preterm delivery, foetal death, and low Apgar score.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	Similar to the previous version of the review, this update identified a probable association between low birth weight and maternal use of potent to very potent topical corticosteroids, especially when the cumulative dosage of topical corticosteroids throughout the pregnancy is very large, which warrants further investigation.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007346.pub3	The finding of a possible protective effect of mild to moderate topical corticosteroids on foetal death could also be examined.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	We found four RCTs that met the inclusion criteria of this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	The total number of included participants was 611 (612 eyes), ranging from 30 to 500 participants per trial.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	One trial was included in the previous version of the review, and we identified three additional trials through the updated searches in July 2014.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	One of the three smaller trials was a pilot study of the largest study: the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	All trials compared the treatment of bacterial keratitis with topical corticosteroid and without topical corticosteroid and had follow-up periods ranging from two months to one year.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	These trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, India, and South Africa.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	All trials reported data on visual acuity ranging from three weeks to one year, and none of them found any important difference between the corticosteroid group and the control group.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	The pilot study of the SCUT reported that time to re-epithelialization in the steroid group was 53% slower than the placebo group after adjusting for baseline epithelial defect size (hazard ratio (HR) 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.94).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	However, the SCUT did not find any important difference in time to re-epithelialization (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	For adverse events, none of the three small trials found any important difference between the two treatment groups.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	The investigators of the largest trial reported that more patients in the control group developed intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (risk ratio (RR) 0.20; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	One trial reported quality of life and concluded that there was no difference between the two groups (data not available).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	We did not find any reports regarding economic outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	Although the four trials were generally of good methodological design, all trials had considerable losses to follow-up (10% or more) in the final analyses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	Further, three of the four trials were underpowered to detect treatment effect differences between groups and inconsistency in outcome measurements precluded meta-analyses for most outcomes relevant to this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	There is inadequate evidence as to the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive topical corticosteroids compared with no topical corticosteroids in improving visual acuity, infiltrate/scar size, or adverse events among participants with bacterial keratitis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005430.pub3	Current evidence does not support a strong effect of corticosteroid, but may be due to insufficient power to detect a treatment effect.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	We included four trials with 450 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	Data on functional outcome and death at end of follow-up were available for 443 participants from three trials.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	Compared with intravenous thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous vascular intervention did not improve the proportion of participants with good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2, risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.25, P = 0.92).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	The quality of evidence was low (outcome assessment was blinded, but not the treating physician or participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	At the end of follow-up, there was a non-significant increase in the proportion of participants who died in the percutaneous vascular intervention group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.14, P = 0.21).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	The quality of evidence was low (wide confidence interval).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	There was no difference in the proportion of participants with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages between the intervention and control groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.95, P = 0.97).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	The quality of evidence was low (wide confidence interval).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	Data on vascular status (recanalisation rate) were only available for seven participants from one trial; we considered this inadequate for statistical analyses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	The present review directly compared intravenous thrombolytic treatment with percutaneous vascular interventions for ischaemic stroke.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	We found no evidence from RCTs that percutaneous vascular interventions are superior to intravenous thrombolytic treatment with respect to functional outcome.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	Quality of evidence was low (outcome assessment was blinded, but not the treating physician or participants).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009292.pub2	New trials with adequate sample sizes are warranted because of the rapid development of new techniques and devices for such interventions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	We included in the review one trial, involving 120 families and 143 children.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	Risk of bias was high because of contamination between groups, as 63% of control group participants accessed day care services separate from those offered within the intervention.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	No evidence suggested that centre-based day care, rather than no treatment (care at home), improved or worsened children's cognitive ability (Griffiths Mental Development Scale, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.01 to 0.69, 127 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence) or psychosocial development (parental report of abnormal development, risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.78, 137 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	No other measures of child intellectual or psychosocial development were reported in the included study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	Moreover, no evidence indicated that centre-based day care, rather than no treatment (care at home), improved or worsened employment of parents, as measured by the number of mothers in full-time or part-time employment (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.48, 114 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence) and maternal hours per week in paid employment (SMD 0.20, 95% -0.15 to 0.55, 127 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence) or household income above £200 per week (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.29, 113 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	This study did not report on long-term outcomes for children (high-school completion or income).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	This review includes one trial that provides inconclusive evidence as regards the effects of centre-based day care for children younger than five years of age and their families in high-income countries.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	Robust guidance for parents, policymakers and other stakeholders on the effects of day care cannot currently be offered on the basis of evidence from randomised controlled trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	Some trials included co-interventions that are unlikely to be found in normal day care centres.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	Effectiveness studies of centre-based day care without these co-interventions are few, and the need for such studies is significant.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2	Comparisons might include home visits or alternative day care arrangements that provide special attention to children from low-income families while exploring possible mechanisms of effect.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	In total, 126 reports describing 30 scoring indices were identified through the screening process.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	Eleven of the 30 scoring indices have undergone some form of index validation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	Intra-rater reliability was assessed for eight scoring indices.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	Inter-rater reliability was evaluated for all 11 of the scoring indices.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	Three of the indices underwent content validation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	Two of the included scoring indices assessed criterion validity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	Six of the included scoring indices explored content validity.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	Two of the included scoring indices were tested for responsiveness.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	The Nancy Index and the Robarts Histopathology Index have undergone the most validation in that four operating properties including reliability, content validity, construct validity (hypothesis testing) and criterion validity have been tested.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	However, none of the currently available histologic scoring indices have been fully validated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	In order to determine the optimal endpoint for histologic healing in UC, more research is required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011256.pub2	The optimal index would need to be fully validated.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	We included three randomised trials that evaluated intramedullary nailing versus plating in 213 participants, with useable data from 173 participants of whom 112 were male.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	The mean age of participants in individual studies ranged from 41 to 44 years.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	There were no trials comparing surgery with non-surgical treatment.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	The three included trials were at high risk of performance bias, with one trial also being at high risk of selection, detection and attrition bias.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	Overall, the quality of available evidence was rated as very low for all outcomes, meaning that we are very unsure about the estimates for all outcomes.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	Although the pooled results of three different measures of foot and ankle function indicated a small difference in favour of nailing (standard mean difference 0.28, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.59; 172 participants, 3 trials), the results of individual trials indicated that this was very unlikely to be a clinically important difference.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	Pooled data (173 participants, 3 trials) for the need for reoperation or substantive physiotherapy for adverse events favoured nailing (4/90 versus 10/83; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.12), but included the possibility of a better outcome after plating.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	Based on an illustrative risk of 100 re-operations for adverse outcomes within one year of plate fixation in 1000 people with these fractures, 63 fewer (95% CI 88 fewer to 12 more) people per 1000 would have re-operations after nailing.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	Similarly pooled data (173 participants, 3 trials) for the symptomatic nonunion or malunion, wound complications and fracture union favoured nailing but the 95% confidence intervals crossed the line of no effect and thus included the possibility of a better outcome after plating.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	Evidence from one trial (85 participants) showed no clinically important difference in pain between the two groups.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	Overall, there is either no or insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the use of surgery or the best surgical intervention for distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	The available evidence, which is of very low quality, found no clinically important differences in function or pain, and did not confirm a difference in the need for re-operation or risk of complications between nailing and plating.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	The addition of evidence from two ongoing trials of nailing versus plating should inform this question in future updates.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010261.pub2	Further randomised trials are warranted on other issues, but should be preceded by research to identify priority questions.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007858.pub2	We included 11 studies involving a total of 38,742 participants: eight studies compared BPLDs versus placebo or no treatment (35,110 participants), and three studies compared different systolic blood pressure targets (3632 participants).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007858.pub2	The risk of bias varied greatly between included studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007858.pub2	The pooled risk ratio (RR) of BPLDs for recurrent stroke was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.93; 8 RCTs; 35,110 participants; moderate-quality evidence), for major vascular event 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.04; 4 RCTs; 28,630 participants; high-quality evidence), and for dementia 0.88 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 2 RCTs; 6671 participants; high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007858.pub2	We mainly observed a reduced risk of recurrent stroke in the subgroup of participants using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a diuretic (I2 statistic for subgroup differences 72.1%; P = 0.006).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007858.pub2	The pooled RR of intensive blood pressure-lowering for recurrent stroke was 0.80 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.00), and for major vascular event 0.58 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.46).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007858.pub2	Our results support the use of BPLDs in people with stroke or TIA for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007858.pub2	Current evidence is primarily derived from trials studying an ACE inhibitor or a diuretic.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD007858.pub2	No definite conclusions can be drawn from current evidence regarding an optimal systolic blood pressure target after stroke or TIA.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001043	Five hundred nineteen men from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials, (lasting 4 to 26 weeks) were assessed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001043	Three trials used non-glucosidic B-sitosterols and one utilized a preparation that contained 100% B-sitosteryl-B-D-glucoside.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001043	B-Sitosterols improved urinary symptom scores and flow measures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001043	The weighted mean difference (WMD) for the IPSS was -4.9 IPSS points (95% CI = -6.3 to -3.5, n = 2 studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001043	The WMD for peak urine flow was 3.91 mL/s (95% CI = 0.91 to 6.90, n = 4 studies) and the WMD for residual volume was -28.62 mL (95% CI = -41.42 to -15.83, n = 4 studies).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001043	The trial using 100% B-sitosteryl-B-D-glucoside (WA184) show improvement in urinary flow measures.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001043	B-sitosterols did not significantly reduce prostate size compared to placebo.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001043	Withdrawal rates for men assigned to B-sitosterol and placebo were 7.8% and 8.0%, respectively.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001043	The evidence suggests non-glucosidic B-sitosterols improve urinary symptoms and flow measures.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001043	Their long term effectiveness, safety and ability to prevent BPH complications are not known.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	The review includes 26 trials comparing salmeterol to placebo and eight trials comparing with salbutamol.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	These included 62,815 participants with asthma (including 2,599 children).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	In six trials (2,766 patients), no serious adverse event data could be obtained.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	All-cause mortality was higher with regular salmeterol than placebo but the increase was not significant (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.33 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.08)).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	Non-fatal serious adverse events were significantly increased when regular salmeterol was compared with placebo (OR 1.15 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	One extra serious adverse event occurred over 28 weeks for every 188 people treated with regular salmeterol (95% CI 95 to 2606).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	There is insufficient evidence to assess whether the risk in children is higher or lower than in adults.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	We found no significant increase in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events when regular salmeterol was compared with regular salbutamol.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	We combined individual patient data from the two largest studies (SNS: n=25,180 and SMART: n=26,355), as all the asthma-related deaths in adults occurred in these studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	In patients who were not taking inhaled corticosteroids, compared to regular salbutamol or placebo, there was a significant increase in risk of asthma-related death with regular salmeterol (Peto OR 6.15 95% CI 1.73 to 21.84).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	The confidence interval for patients who were taking inhaled corticosteroids is wide and cannot rule in or out an increase in asthma mortality in the presence of an inhaled corticosteroid (Peto OR 2.03 95% CI 0.82 to 5.00).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	In comparison with placebo, we have found an increased risk of serious adverse events with regular salmeterol.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	There is also a clear increase in risk of asthma-related mortality in patients not using inhaled corticosteroids in the two large surveillance studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	Although the increase in asthma-related mortality was smaller in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline, the confidence interval is wide, so we cannot conclude that the inhaled corticosteroids abolish the risks of regular salmeterol.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD006363.pub2	The adverse effects of regular salmeterol in children remain uncertain due to the small number of children studied.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005946.pub2	Two studies enrolled preterm infants with respiratory distress.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005946.pub2	Amato (1988) allocated infants to L-thyroxine 50 μg/dose at 1 and at 24 hours or no treatment.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD005946.pub2	Both studies had methodological concerns including quasi-random methods of patient allocation, no blinding of treatment or measurement and substantial post allocation losses.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD005946.pub2	Neither study reported any significant benefits in neonatal morbidity or mortality from use of thyroid hormones.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD005946.pub2	Meta-analysis of two studies (80 infants) found no significant difference in mortality to discharge (typical RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.47, 2.14).	0

10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	No new studies were included from searches for this update.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	Overall, risk of bias was low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD006089.pub5	We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001964.pub4	Eight RCTs (enrolling 2515 patients) met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001964.pub4	Three RCTs (all performed in Asian countries) compared D3 with D2 lymphadenectomy: data suggested no significant difference in OS between these two types of lymph node dissection (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21), with no significant difference in postoperative mortality (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.73).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001964.pub4	Data for DFS were available only from one trial and for no trial were DSS data available.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001964.pub4	Five RCTs (n = 3 European; n = 2 Asian) compared D2 to D1 lymphadenectomy: OS (n = 5; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17) and DFS (n=3; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07) findings suggested no significant difference between these two types of lymph node dissection.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001964.pub4	In contrast, D2 lymphadenectomy was associated with a significantly better DSS compared to D1 lymphadenectomy (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92), the quality of the body of evidence being moderate; however, D2 lymphadenectomy was also associated with a higher postoperative mortality rate (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.04).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001964.pub4	D2 lymphadenectomy can improve DSS in patients with resectable carcinoma of the stomach, although the increased incidence of postoperative mortality reduces its therapeutic benefit.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	Thirteen studies, 1158 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	Comparing naltrexone versus placebo or no pharmacological treatments, no statistically significant difference were noted for all the primary outcomes considered.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	The only outcome statistically significant in favour of naltrexone is re incarceration, RR 0.47 (95%CI 0.26-0.84), but results come only from two studies.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	Considering only studies were patients were forced to adherence a statistical significant difference in favour of naltrexone was found for retention and abstinence, RR 2.93 (95%CI 1.66-5.18).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	Comparing naltrexone versus psychotherapy, in the two considered outcomes, no statistically significant difference was found in the single study considered.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	Naltrexone was not superior to benzodiazepines and to buprenorphine for retention and abstinence and side effects.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	Results come from single studies.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	The findings of this review suggest that oral naltrexone did not perform better than treatment with placebo or no pharmacological agent with respect to the number of participants re-incarcerated during the study period.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	If oral naltrexone is compared with other pharmacological treatments such as benzodiazepine and buprenorphine, no statistically significant difference was found.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	The percentage of people retained in treatment in the included studies is however low (28%).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	The conclusion of this review is that the studies conducted have not allowed an adequate evaluation of oral naltrexone treatment in the field of opioid dependence.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4	Consequently, maintenance therapy with naltrexone cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	No trials on modification of food met the inclusion criteria.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	We included two studies that examined modification to fluids.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	Both were part of the same large multicentre trial and included people with dementia and people with or without dementia and Parkinson's disease.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	Participation in the second trial was determined by results from the first trial.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	With unpublished data supplied by study authors, we examined data from participants with dementia only.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	The first study, a cross-over trial, investigated the immediate effects on aspiration of two viscosities of liquids (nectar thick and honey thick) compared to regular liquids in 351 participants with dementia using videofluoroscopy.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	Regular liquids with a chin down head posture, as well as regular liquids without any intervention were also compared.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	The sequence of interventions during videofluoroscopy may have influenced response to intervention.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	The second study, a parallel designed RCT, compared the effect of nectar and honey thick liquids with a chin down head posture over a three-month period in a subgroup of 260 participants with dementia.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	Outcomes were pneumonia and adverse intervention effects.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	Honey thick liquids, which are more consistent with descriptors for 'spoon thick' or 'extremely thick' liquids, showed a more positive impact on immediate elimination of aspiration during videofluoroscopy, but this consistency showed more adverse effects in the second follow-up study.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	During the second three-month follow-up trial, there were a greater number of incidents of pneumonia in participants receiving honey thick liquids than those receiving nectar thick liquids or taking regular liquids with a chin down posture.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	There were no deaths classified as 'definitely related' to the type of fluids prescribed.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	Neither trial addressed quality of life.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	Risk of bias for both studies is high.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	The overall quality of evidence for outcomes in this review is low.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	We are uncertain about the immediate and long-term effects of modifying the consistency of fluid for swallowing difficulties in dementia as too few studies have been completed.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	There may be differences in outcomes depending on the grade of thickness of fluids and the sequence of interventions trialled in videofluoroscopy for people with dementia.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	Clinicians should be aware that while thickening fluids may have an immediate positive effect on swallowing, the long-term impact of thickened fluids on the health of the person with dementia should be considered.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2	Further high-quality clinical trials are required.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	Six randomised controlled trials with a total of 788 women were included.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	The largest of these trials included 396 women eligible for this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	No evidence of a statistically significant difference was found between natural cycle and standard IVF in live birth rates (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01, two studies, 425 women, I2= 0%, moderate quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	The evidence suggests that for a woman with a 53% chance of live birth using standard IVF, the chance using natural cycle IVF would range from 34% to 53%.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference between natural cycle and standard IVF in rates of OHSS (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06, one study, 60 women, very low quality evidence), clinical pregnancy (OR 0.52 95% CI 0.17 to 1.61, 4 studies, 351 women, I2=63%, low quality evidence), ongoing pregnancy (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.05, three studies, 485 women, I2=0%, moderate quality evidence), multiple pregnancy (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.31, 2 studies, 527 women, I2=0%, very low quality evidence), gestational abnormalities (OR 0.44 95% CI 0.03 to 5.93, 1 study, 18 women, very low quality evidence) or cycle cancellations (OR 8.98, 95% CI 0.20 to 393.66, 2 studies, 159 women, I2=83%, very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	One trial reported that the oocyte retrieval rate was significantly lower in the natural cycle group (MD -4.40, 95% CI -7.87 to -0.93, 60 women, very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	There were insufficient data to draw any conclusions about rates of treatment cancellation.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	Findings on treatment costs were inconsistent and more data are awaited.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	The evidence was limited by imprecision.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	Findings for pregnancy rate and for cycle cancellation were sensitive to the choice of statistical model: for these outcomes, use of a fixed effect model suggested a benefit for the standard IVF group.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	Moreover the largest trial has not yet completed follow up, though data have been reported for over 95% of women.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	Further evidence from well conducted large trials is awaited on natural cycle IVF treatment.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	Future trials should compare natural cycle IVF with standard IVF.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD010550.pub2	Outcomes should include cumulative live birth and pregnancy rates, the number of treatment cycles necessary to reach live birth, treatment costs and adverse effects.	0

10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	Programmes lasted for six weeks to one year.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	All included studies were RCTs; three studies used allocation concealment, six reported blinded outcome assessors and three studies adopted an intention-to-treat approach to statistical analysis.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	No adverse events were reported.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	Quality of evidence of the outcomes ranged from very low to moderate.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	Analysis was split into three comparisons: (1) Tai Chi versus usual care; (2) Tai Chi and breathing exercise versus breathing exercise alone; and (3) Tai Chi and exercise versus exercise alone.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	Comparison of Tai Chi versus usual care revealed that Tai Chi demonstrated a longer six-minute walk distance (mean difference (MD) 29.64 metres, 95% confidence interval (CI) 10.52 to 48.77 metres; participants = 318; I2 = 59%) and better pulmonary function (i.e. forced expiratory volume in one second, MD 0.11 L, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20 L; participants = 258; I2 = 0%) in post-programme data.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	However, the effects of Tai Chi in reducing dyspnoea level and improving quality of life remain inconclusive.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	Data are currently insufficient for evaluating the impact of Tai Chi on maximal exercise capacity, balance and muscle strength in people with COPD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	Comparison of Tai Chi and other interventions (i.e. breathing exercise or exercise) versus other interventions shows no superiority and no additional effects on symptom improvement nor on physical and psychosocial outcomes with Tai Chi.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	No adverse events were reported, implying that Tai Chi is safe to practise in people with COPD.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	Evidence of very low to moderate quality suggests better functional capacity and pulmonary function in post-programme data for Tai Chi versus usual care.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	When Tai Chi in addition to other interventions was compared with other interventions alone, Tai Chi did not show superiority and showed no additional effects on symptoms nor on physical and psychosocial function improvement in people with COPD.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	With the diverse style and number of forms being adopted in different studies, the most beneficial protocol of Tai Chi style and number of forms could not be commented upon.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD009953.pub2	Hence, future studies are warranted to address these topics.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	We included 72 trials that involved 2470 participants.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	This review includes 35 new studies in addition to the studies included in the previous version of this review.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	Study sample sizes were generally small and interventions varied in terms of both the goals of treatment and the virtual reality devices used.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear due to poor reporting.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	Thus, while there are a large number of randomised controlled trials, the evidence remains mostly low quality when rated using the GRADE system.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	Control groups usually received no intervention or therapy based on a standard-care approach.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	Primary outcome: results were not statistically significant for upper limb function (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -0.05 to 0.20, 22 studies, 1038 participants, low-quality evidence) when comparing virtual reality to conventional therapy.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	However, when virtual reality was used in addition to usual care (providing a higher dose of therapy for those in the intervention group) there was a statistically significant difference between groups (SMD 0.49, 0.21 to 0.77, 10 studies, 210 participants, low-quality evidence).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	Secondary outcomes: when compared to conventional therapy approaches there were no statistically significant effects for gait speed or balance.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	Results were statistically significant for the activities of daily living (ADL) outcome (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43, 10 studies, 466 participants, moderate-quality evidence); however, we were unable to pool results for cognitive function, participation restriction, or quality of life.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	Twenty-three studies reported that they monitored for adverse events; across these studies there were few adverse events and those reported were relatively mild.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	We found evidence that the use of virtual reality and interactive video gaming was not more beneficial than conventional therapy approaches in improving upper limb function.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	Virtual reality may be beneficial in improving upper limb function and activities of daily living function when used as an adjunct to usual care (to increase overall therapy time).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effect of virtual reality and interactive video gaming on gait speed, balance, participation, or quality of life.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	This review found that time since onset of stroke, severity of impairment, and the type of device (commercial or customised) were not strong influencers of outcome.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4	There was a trend suggesting that higher dose (more than 15 hours of total intervention) was preferable as were customised virtual reality programs; however, these findings were not statistically significant.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	We identified five RCTs (1330 participants) that met the inclusion criteria.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	None of the included trials examined regimens of less than six months duration.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	Fluoroquinolones added to standard regimens	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	A single trial (174 participants) added levofloxacin to the standard first-line regimen.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	Relapse and treatment failure were not reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	For death, sputum conversion, and adverse events we are uncertain if there is an effect (one trial, 174 participants, very low quality evidence for all three outcomes).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	Fluoroquinolones substituted for ethambutol in standard regimens	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	Three trials (723 participants) substituted ethambutol with moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and ofloxacin into the standard first-line regimen.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	For relapse, we are uncertain if there is an effect (one trial, 170 participants, very low quality evidence).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	No trials reported on treatment failure.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	For death, sputum culture conversion at eight weeks, or serious adverse events we do not know if there was an effect (three trials, 723 participants, very low quality evidence for all three outcomes).	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	Fluoroquinolones substituted for isoniazid in standard regimens	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	A single trial (433 participants) substituted moxifloxacin for isoniazid.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	Treatment failure and relapse were not reported.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	For death, sputum culture conversion, or serious adverse events the substitution may have little or no difference (one trial, 433 participants, low quality evidence for all three outcomes).	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	Fluoroquinolines in four month regimens	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	Six trials are currently in progress testing shorter regimens with fluoroquinolones.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	Ofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin have been tested in RCTs of standard first-line regimens based on rifampicin and pyrazinamide for treating drug-sensitive TB.	0
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	There is insufficient evidence to be clear whether addition or substitution of fluoroquinolones for ethambutol or isoniazid in the first-line regimen reduces death or relapse, or increases culture conversion at eight weeks.	1
10.1002/14651858.CD004795.pub4	Much larger trials with fluoroquinolones in short course regimens of four months are currently in progress.	1
